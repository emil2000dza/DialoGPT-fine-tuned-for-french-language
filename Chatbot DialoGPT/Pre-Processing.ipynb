C’est bien beau les écologistes mais il ne faut pas oublier… Il faut prendre en compte le point de vue de tout le monde. Parce que j’ai beaucoup entendu parler des paysans qui ont besoin de ces retenues d’eau. Si on ne fait pas le barrage ils vont manquer d’eau, s’ils manquent d’eau ils ne pourront pas faire leur production, s’ils ne font pas leur production ils ne vont pas avoir de quoi pouvoir vivre… C’est un peu comme les gens comme Bové qui détruisent les « pins fraiches » c’est ça ? Le jour où vraiment on arrête le traditionnel et que les gens veulent trouver de quoi manger et que les gens crèveront de faim on dira « Eh on a faim ». Ils détruisent les cultures .. Ils faudrait lasser ces cultures, faire des tests, études pour voir si c’est dangereux ou pas dangereux.. Bon c’est vrai qu’il y a des lobbies, des grosses sociétés qui ont beaucoup d’enjeux,… Mais je veux dire un jour ou l’autre quand la population mondiale sera trop importante il faudra nourrir ces gens là et si on continue à faire une future traditionnelle comme on le fait actuellement je pense qu’il n’y aura pas assez pour tous ces gens. On le voit d’ailleurs actuellement avec ce qui s’est passé l’année dernière avec le blé en Bourgogne… les prix ont sacrement augmenté sur le blé et ça a poussé les peuples en URSS où il y avait eu la sécheresse et les champs de blé avaient brulé, je veux dire qu’il faut essayer de voir dans le futur ce qui peut se passer. Et le truc de Sievens aussi, bon ce que j’ai entendu dire, bon je ne sais pas je ne m’en suis pas occupé du sujet parce que ça me concerne pas, mais je veux dire que c’est un projet qui date d’il y a 10 ans. Il y a 10 ans ils ont fait des études, ils ont demandé à des gens nanani nanana et ils ne l’ont fait que 10 ans après et au bout de ces 10 ans ils ont pas refais d’études, voilà, ils ont IM:PO:SÉ. Et c’est ça qui a fait qu’àun moment donné, les gens ont tellement marre qu’on leur impose les choses qu’ils se rebiffent quoi, je les comprends. Il faut voir aussi que ce barrage est très important pour la région mais que c’est quelque chose d’économique. Il ne faut pas ignorer que ces gens ont besoin de l’eau pour leur boulot aussi : la retenue d’eau à lieu d’être, maintenant il faudrait faire des études supplémentaires pour essayer de voire pour autre chose. Bon il ne faut pas toujours être entièrement contre, il faut arriver à un juste milieu. Que l’Etat se concerte. Bon c’est malheureux à dire, mais je crois que maintenant on arrive un peu à une période où on impose les choses, on ne demande pas aux gens. C’est comme nous au travail c’est pareil on nous demande pas, c’est tout simple même pour une tenue de travail : on ne demande pas ce qu’on aurait besoin voilà.', ' Vous pensez qu’il y a un problème de communication ?', ' Oui il y a un problème de communication et je veux dire que sur les tenues de travail à un moment donné on nous a donné des tenues de travail sans poches, on ne pouvait pas mettre les outils de travail où on voulait. Nous quand on va travailler sur place si on a besoin d’une poche pour mettre un stylo bah ça ne fonctionne pas. Je veux dire on nous impose et on nous demande pas notre avis.', ' C’est ce qui se passe aussi en politique quand ils font des lois non adaptées ?', ' Après tout le monde s’est plaint parce que c’était pas pratique et après ils ont refait des trucs, ils nous ont redonné d’autres vêtements et les autres sont partis à la poubelle. Alors où vous voyez qu’il faut faire des économies là-dedans ? Ils ont voulu acheter des vêtements bon marché et en fin de compte on les a mis à la poubelle. C’est que maintenant il y a l’élite, il y a les (BLANC) … Disons qu’avant il y avait l’ouvrier, il y avait le technicien supérieur, il y avait l’ingénieur et il y avait le patron. Et maintenant la hiérarchie elle est tellement caractérisée: moi je suis technicien supérieur et je fais le travail d’un ouvrier, et les ingénieurs bon bref. A un moment donné on fait un autre boulot que le notre. On ne nous concerte pas sur notre façon de travailler.', ' Il y aurait donc un réel problème de communication qui aboutit à des pertes en termes d’argent notamment ?', ' Oui. Il y a aussi par rapport à Sievens, quand on regarde tout ce qui a été mis en service, tout ce qui a été fait avec tout cet argent pour tout ça. C’est de l’argent qui va être foutu en l’air. C’est un peu comme l’éco-taxe, parce que l’éco-taxe …les gens ont gueulé c’est normal parce qu’il faudrait peut-être l’adapter. Les gens ont gueulé et puis en fin de compte ils l’ont abrogée l’éco-taxe. En attendant quand on regarde tous les portiques… Les sociétés qui ont travaillé, la société qui s’occupait de tout ça et bien en fin de compte ça va lui revenir EXTREMEMENT (il appuie le terme) cher et ça va être toujours pareil, ça va être toujours les mêmes qui vont payer. Parce que déjà regarde bien l’éco-taxe ils parlent de mettre 6 centimes sur l’essence pour ne pas avoir passé l’éco-taxe. Et en fin de compte pour un truc qui allait concerner une seule catégorie de personne, je ne dis pas que c’est normal ils auraient dû adapter par rapport aux étrangers notamment, je veux dire tout le monde va payer pour un truc qui nous concerne pas.', ' Que pensez-vous du fait que les politiques ne terminent pas leurs projets, ce qui induit une grosse perte d’argent ?', ' C’est ce que je te dis. Les projets mettent tellement de temps à se mettre en oeuvre. Parce que l’éco-taxe c’est le rendement avant tout: le temps qui fasse des données, des tests et tout ça…deux trois ans après les gens ils en ont tellement marre d’être sur-fiscalisés que cette taxe en plus n’est pas passée. Peut-être que dès que cette taxe a été voté elle serait passée à l’époque. C’est-à- dire qu’il y a un problème de délais en fait.', ' En quoi et comment avez vous entendu les gens parler de ces problèmes d’éco-taxe, de Sievens dans la région ? Notamment au niveau familial, en avez-vous parlé avec votre famille ?', ' Non, pas du tout. Déjà j’en discute pas. C’est pas le peu où je suis à Toulouse que j’en discute avec mes parents. Et puis Martin je ne le vois que de temps en temps donc on peut pas en discuter. Et c’est vrai que quand je suis chez moi j’ai envie de discuter d’autre chose que des problèmes. On arrive à un certain moment où on s’est presque fait une bulle avec notre monde et on essaie de se protéger nous-même … (BLANC) parce que si on continue à parler de nos problèmes on s’en sort plus parce qu’avec les problèmes au travail, les problèmes ici, les problèmes et tout nanana si tout s’ajoute on va penser qu’à ça.', ' Est ce que vous pensez qu’en politique on ne parle que des problèmes actuellement et qu’on ne parle pas de ce qui pourrait être une bonne réforme ? En quoi vous pensez qu’au final la politique on ne la met que dans une case négative ?', ' J’ai l’impression oui. Le problème aussi c’est qu’on critique le gouvernement. Chaque fois que le gouvernement fait quelque chose, regarde, si c’est la gauche, c’est la droite qui va dire au scandale et si c’est la droite c’est le gauche qui crie au scandale. A force et quand on voit toutes ces histoires de magouilles de truc comme ça, à force les Français4 en ont marre. Si on regarde le truc aussi avec tous les privilèges. Hollande qui promet de baisser les frais de l’Elysée mais chaque année ils arrêtent pas d’augmenter donc à un moment les gens ils en ont tellement marre qu’après on va arriver à (BLANC) je ne dis pas une révolution5 mais un jour où quelqu’un en aura tellement marre que ça risque d’être assez dangereux je pense. Je ne dis pas qu’on va arriver comme mai 68 mais … Regarde, il ne faut pas grand chose pour que les gens qui en ont vraiment marre … voilà…'], [' Pourriez-vous me faire un descriptif de l’école ? De la commune ? Je crois à peu près 2500 habitants.', ' Tout à fait. Donc c’est une école avec 5 classes, 121 élèves. Avec une école maternelle à côté, indépendante. Avec 3 classes sur l’école maternelle euh... La maternelle est indépendante. Oui. Donc, petite commune, le public est... principalement des ruraux, des commerçants ou des gens qui travaillent dans la fonction publique principalement sur R.. B. est plutôt une ville dortoir entre guillemets.', ' Oui c’est ça, il y a beaucoup de monde qui travaille à R. et plutôt classe moyenne ?', ' Oui, plutôt classe moyenne. Oui, on n’a pas beaucoup d’enfants d’ouvriers sur B.', ' Et pas beaucoup d’enfants de familles fortunées ?', ' Non. C’est vraiment plutôt des classes moyennes. Voilà.', ' Vous êtes déchargé ?', ' Oui. Je suis déchargé une journée par semaine. Le mardi.', ' Et sinon, vous avez un CM2?', ' Et sinon j’ai un CM2. Voilà. Ce qui est particulier, c’est que ce n’est que depuis le début de l’année que je suis dans cette école. L’année dernière, j’étais directeur de l’école maternelle de P., qui a fermé, enfin qui a été fusionnée avec l’école élémentaire. Voilà.', ' Je ne savais pas.', ' Et puis avant, j’avais passé trois ans ici en CM2, ou avec un CM1-CM2.', ' D’accord. En ce moment, il y a une classe par niveau ?', ' Il y a une classe par niveau à peu près. Il y a un CP, un CP-CE1 et ensuite un CE2, un CM1 et un CM2. On dépend du réseau d’aide de T.. On a assez peu de relations avec le réseau à part avec la psychologue. Il faut dire que le réseau est incomplet : il n’y a pas de maître E. Donc le maître G qui peut intervenir éventuellement. Mais enfin c’est assez loin. Il intervient dans les faits assez peu.', ' Et vous avez des besoins ?', ' Et on a - oui (rire) - des besoins certains. Et les relations sont intermittentes....', ' Et vous appartenez à quelle circonscription ?', ' R.', ' Et votre IEN ?', ' C’est une nouvelle inspectrice. C’est Mme G. depuis cette année. Et elle est à R.. Je lui ai demandé une autorisation.', ' Oui, je sais. Monsieur M me l’a dit.', ' (Il bredouille).', ' Oui, ça se comprend fort bien. Vous avez une brigade qui vous remplace le mardi ?', ' Disons que c’est une personne qui fait plusieurs décharges de direction. C’est mon épouse (rire) c’est pratique ! Elle fait deux jours à P., une journée à V., et une journée à B.', ' je vous avais dit, je crois, lorsque j’ai pris rendez vous que je voulais que nous parlions des evaluations nationales. Et comme vous êtes enseignant en CM2, je vais vous poser des questions sur ça ; puis j’aurai quelques questions spécifiques à votre statut de directeur, puisque vous êtes directeur en même temps.', ' D’accord.', ' J’aimerais d’abord savoir comment ces evaluations se sont passées ?', ' Bien (il éclate de rire).', ' Je n’en doute pas ! Mais encore...', ' Ben moi je l’avais mise en place la première année où les évaluations avaient eu lieu et je les avais trouvé difficiles. Dans la mesure où c’était tôt dans l’année et où ça s’appuyait sur le programme du CM2, avec un changement de programme qui était tout récent, puisque c’était les programmes 2008. Et donc, dans les faits, on n’avait pas réussi à mettre en place aussi rapidement que souhaitable (petit rire gêné) comme c’était souhaitable c’est vrai, mais cette année on a réussi à mettre en place les évaluations. Mais c’est vrai que cette année les évaluations étaient plus d’un niveau CM1 ; en tout cas, des propositions qui étaient faites au niveau des programmes et disons que ça correspondait à ce qu’on pouvait attendre effectivement à ce moment de l’année des CM2. C’est vrai que ça était assez intéressant de pouvoir justement porter un regard assez neutre sur les élèves puisque, du fait de, justement, des évaluations.', ' Pourquoi vous dites assez neutre ?', ' Neutre au sens où... lorsque... Je trouve que lorsqu’on évalue l’élève que l’on a en classe - même si on se donne des critères d’évaluation assez formels - il n’empêche quand même qu’on sait ce qu’on peut attendre de l’élève et ça interagit forcément. Alors que là, dans la mesure où il y a un protocole assez précis comme le choix des exercices, c’est pas nous qui l’avons fait. Du coup, ça permet d’avoir un regard plus neutre... plus... différent.', ' Comme il n’y a qu’un CM2 dans l’école, vous êtes le seul à avoir fait passer l’évaluation de CM2 ?', ' Oui.', ' Comment vous êtes-vous organisé ?', ' ...', ' Comment vous avez ? est-ce que vous avez fait des aménagements d’emploi du temps ou...', ' Oui. On a banalisé cette semaine-là l’emploi du temps. L’emploi du temps n’a pas été respecté. Donc, de mémoire, je crois qu’on a fait passer le lundi les deux premières séances maths et français et ensuite le jeudi la deuxième et le vendredi la troisième.', ' Vous avez dit « on » ?', ' Non. J’ai.', ' Parce que votre femme ?', ' Non, elle ne s’en est pas occupée.', ' Vous aviez annoncé à vos élèves l’évaluation ?', ' Oui, je l’avais annoncée aux élèves. Et aussi aux parents en début d’année.', ' En tant qu’enseignant ou en tant que directeur ?', ' En tant que directeur. Plutôt en tant que directeur plutôt qu’enseignant. Donc les élèves s’y attendaient à ce moment là. Les réactions étaient assez diverses. Je crois qu’il y avait, comment dirais-je une valorisation de faire partie de quelque chose de national. Savoir que leurs cousins qui étaient dans la même classe dans le département passaient la même chose au même moment. Voilà, ça présentait quand même, voilà, un caractère un petit peu valorisant mais y avait quand même un réel stress.', ' C’est vous qui l’avez présenté de façon valorisante ?', ' Euh... (rire)... je sais pas, j’ai essayé de la présenter de la façon la plus neutre possible en disant que, voilà il y avait des évaluations. Moi, j’ai essayé d’insister auprès des élèves sur le fait que c’était pas un examen de passage pour la 6ème. Que de toutes façons c’était bien trop tôt dans l’année. Par contre on allait à partir de ces évaluations voir les points qui n’étaient pas encore complètement acquis et j’ai essayé de présenter la façon dont on allait essayer de travailler ensuite.', ' D’accord.', ' Pour traiter ces points là... Donc, j’ai reçu après chaque... après ces évaluations, j’ai reçu individuellement tous les parents.', ' Oui, on va y venir. J’aimerai revenir sur un point. Vous avez dit tout À l’heure la première année. Là ce n’était pas le cas. Vous voyez des différences avec la première année ?', ' Oui, sur le niveau des exercices. Sur le fait que ça devienne routi... que ça devienne une habitude. Je pense qu’on était un petit peu dans l’inconnu forcément la première année. Le fait qu’il y avait aussi toute une levée de boucliers autour de ces évaluations là... et que là, le regard et des parents et des élèves n’étaient pas forcément le même parce que... En fait, les élèves savaient que l’an dernier, leurs camarades l’avaient passée également. Donc ils savaient un petit peu à quoi...', ' Vous parlez de levée de bouclier. Il y en a eu beaucoup dans le département ?', ' Dans le département oui... mais disons que c’était surtout l’écho national.', ' Oui, mais on entend toujours au mois de janvier... il y a des articles dans la presse.', ' Oui, mais j’ai l’impression que c’était moins présent cette année. Peut-être que j’y faisais moins attention. Mais j’ai l’impression que c’était moins présent cette année.', ' Et vous l’expliquez ?', ' Je pense que d’abord le fait que ça devienne une habitude ; et puis je crois aussi... Enfin, les évaluations de l’an dernier je ne les avais pas faite puisque j’étais effectivement en maternelle ; mais j’avais jeté un coup d’œil... Le niveau exigé. Enfin le niveau sur lequel portaient ces évaluations était plus en cohérence avec ce qu’on pouvait faire en fin de CM1 ou en début de CM2.', ' Vous avez posé toutes les questions ?', ' Oui.', ' Vous avez pu faire tous les exercices qui étaient demandés?', ' Oui.', ' Vous n’avez pas du tout sélectionné certaines choses et laisse tomber d’autres choses ?', ' Non. Non, non. Et en laissant le temps imparti. Et voilà... J’essaie vraiment de coller. Alors que c’était pas forcément ce que je faisais la première année lorsque j’ai fait passer les évaluations. Par exemple sur le temps demandé, j’ai été moins strict. Là vraiment j’ai essayé de coller au maximum à ce qui était demandé. Aux instructions.', ' Et vous l’avez fait. pour quelles raisons vous avez changé votre choix ?', ' Disons je voulais pas fausser. Et quel que soit le regard qu’on peut porter sur ces évaluations. Voilà, il fallait aussi que je ne fausse pas cette évaluation là. (silence)', ' Vous pouvez m’en dire plus sur votre regard ?', ' Ben... Ben... Comme je vous disais, les premières évaluations, quand je les ai reçues, j’étais un petit peu surpris du niveau d’exigence effectivement qui était trop élevé...', ' A ce moment là ?', ' Tandis que là... le fait aussi d’avoir travaillé en équipe sur la mise en œuvre des programmes 2008, sur l’utilisation des instructions...', ' Au sein de l’école', ' Oui, au sein de l’école.', ' De cette école puisque vous y étiez avant de partir en maternelle.', ' Oui. Disons qu’on en a discuté en conseil de cycle. Et donc, ça a permis de clarifier. D’éclaircir un certain nombre de choses, de s’approprier aussi ces programmes. Les évaluations, les premières fois qu’on les a faites passer, on était en plein... En pleine découverte quoi.', ' Et la remontée des résultats comment vous l’avez opérée ?', ' Euh... Euh...', ' Vous ne l’avez pas transmise au directeur puisque c’est vous !', ' Non (rire) je l’ai fait directement.', ' Comment ça se passe ?', ' Ça remonte par l’application internet dédiée à ces évaluations là.', ' Une application nationale. ', ' Oui. Les résultats sont entrés sur Excel au niveau local. Ensuite on [la circonscription] ne transmet qu’une partie anonyme. Ce qui permet après de lever les doutes sur l’utilisation des résultats...', ' A Votre avis, à quoi ça sert ces résultats ? ces évaluations ? Quels en sont les objectifs ?', ' Vous voulez dire au niveau de l’institution ? Au niveau national ?', ' Oui, ou du votre... Comment vous expliqueriez quels sont les objectifs de ces évaluations ? Vous avez peut-être du l’expliquer aux parents ou...', ' Moi, j’ai beaucoup insisté sur le fait que c’était un outil pour l’enseignant. Effectivement, une photographie des compétences de l’élève à un moment donné et à partir de là élaborer un programme jusqu’à la fin de l’année pour travailler... pour reprendre les points qui méritaient d’être repris.', ' Vous vous en servez donc.', ' Tout à fait.', ' Vous aménagez votre enseignement en fonction des résultats.', ' Oui, tout à fait.', ' Vous pouvez donner un exemple ?', ' Ben disons qu’à partir des évaluations, je prends les différents domaines où l’enfant n’est pas en réussite... pouvait avoir certaines difficultés et ensuite chaque semaine j’ai deux temps d’une heure pendant lesquels je fais des ateliers que j’appelle PPRE [Programme personnalisé de réussite éducative], puisqu’à partir de chaque résultat d’évaluation j’ai eu une sorte de PPRE. Puis et à partir de là je travaille avec les élèves par petits groupes sur les points sur lesquels ils n’ont pas été forcément en réussite à ces évaluations. Donc c’est euh c’est vraiment très souple parce que cela peut être une question sur la lecture de l’heure par exemple où les enfants se sont trompés.', ' Oui.', ' Il suffit de deux séances pour que la plupart des enfants se souviennent de la façon dont on pouvait dire l’heure et ne fassent pas les erreurs qu’ils ont pu faire au moment des évaluations. Par contre autre chose, je pense notamment aux mathématiques sur les décimaux, sur les fractions où c’est que... Où certains élèves continuaient...voilà, pouvaient continuer à avoir des difficultés. Mais bon, globalement pour un nombre décimal, ils faisaient la distinction entre un nombre entier un nombre décimal ; et c’est vrai qu’au regard de ces évaluations je me suis aperçu que fallait sans doute reprendre certaines choses. J’ai un petit groupe de 6-7 élèves avec lesquels on reprend chaque semaine ces choses là et où on repart. Là, l’intérêt c’est que je... Je me suis vraiment aperçu qu’il fallait enfin repartir du début hein ! Revoir la multiplication etc.', ' C’est compliqué les fractions. Et sur le travail d’équipe ça a eu un impact', ' Ça a eu un impact. Donc en conseil de cycle on a analysé les résultats. Avec une situation un peu particulière puisque la collègue donc qui avait les CM1 est en congé maternité ; donc c’est la remplaçante qui est là jusqu’à la fin de l’année et le collègue qui est actuellement en CE2 n’était pas là les années précédentes. Dans l’école ça a pas mal changé. Mais on a quand même choisi de voir les résultats de ces évaluations et on a identifié deux points sur lesquels il fallait qu’on travaille ensemble euh... Les élèves ne sont pas en grande réussite sur la grammaire. Notamment sur les notions de nature et de fonction ; donc on a décidé de clarifier déjà entre nous les termes utilisés et de se donner vraiment une progression.', ' Qu’est-ce qu’on utilise comme terme ?', ' Sur les déterminants par exemple, il y a un moment certains utilisaient des termes comme déterminants démonstratifs ; d’autres adjectifs démonstratifs voilà... donc il fallait au moins se mettre au point là-dessus et surtout sur ce qu’on attendait en fin de chaque année quoi, de chaque... Voilà. Ce qu’on pouvait attendre en termes d’analyse sur les fonctions quoi.', ' Un travail en amont qui permettrait aux élèves de réussir mieux ces évaluations', ' Tout à fait. Et en CM. Et de la même façon avec la collègue on a prévu de travailler en CM1 sur l’introduction justement des nombres décimaux et sur les fractions. En se disant que peut-être qu’on allait leur laisser plus de temps pour la manipulation et sur la découverte de ces notions en CE2 et puis en CM1. Qu’ensuite en CM2 il n’y ait pas ce dont on vient de parler : des élèves qui arrivent en janvier de CM2 et qui en fait ne comprennent pas ce qu’est véritablement le nombre décimal, les fractions…', ' Vous avez à part ces histoires globales - comme pour ce qui est des nombres décimaux et les fractions ou de certains points de grammaire - Vous avez eu des surprises ? par rapport à certains élèves en particulier ?', ' Disons que j’ai une classe qui est assez hété… disons qui a une structure particulière. J’ai 5 élèves qui ont un an de retard et j’ai 5 élèves qui ont un an d’avance.', ' Ils redoublent cette année ?', ' Non, aucun ne redouble le CM2 cette année. C’était plutôt le CP-CE1 qu’ils ont redoublé. Voilà.', ' Donc 5 qui ont un an de retard et 5 qui ont un an d’avance.', ' C’est ça. 5 qui ont un an de retard et 5 qui ont un an d’avance. Et 13 qui sont d’âge normal.', ' Ils ont sauté une classe ? ceux qui ont de l’avance ?', ' Oui. En maternelle. Parce qu’avant ils ont fait moyenne section/CP', ' Parce qu’il y avait une moyenne section- grande section combinés ?', ' Non. Non. Voilà ça s’est trouvé comme ca. La situation locale est un peu particulière. La grande section avait sans doute une réputation… disons pas très bonne…(toux gênée)… voilà !', ' Donc les parents ont évité l’enseignant.', ' Vous avez tout compris ! Excusez moi mon fils m’appelle… [Il revient]', ' Votre fils est à la maternelle ?', ' Non, il est en CP. Il a sauté.', ' Vous êtes dans le même cas de figure.', ' [Là, il rit mais de bon cœur ; en fait cela détend un peu l’atmosphère].', ' On en était...', ' Oui. Si. J’étais surpris. Oui… j’ai été surpris comment dirais-je… à la fois pour les élèves qui étaient en grande réussite des scores qu’ils pouvaient obtenir, qui étaient vraiment très élevés. Voilà. Et à la fois des élèves qui étaient en difficulté, des très faibles scores.', ' Grand écart', ' Oui. J’ai une courbe de Gauss inversée moi. Sur les évaluations, ce qui est un peu… Ce qui est un peu étonnant. Donc ça a bien éclairé la classe.', ' Est-ce que vous avez noté une relation avec l’âge des élèves ?', ' Oui. Enfin avec l’âge non, avec le fait que certains aient redoublé.', ' Ceux qui ont redoublé ont toujours des faibles scores', ' Oui, voilà. Ceux qui ont redoublé ont de faibles scores et ceux qui ont un an d’avance des scores très élevés. Voilà. Y a que sur une élève, elle a des scores moyens avec un an d’avance.', ' Et les élèves d’âge normal ? Il n’y en a pas qui sont très mauvais et d’autres qui sont très bons en fonction du milieu social par exemple ?', ' Non. C’est ça qui est curieux. C’est assez étonnant.', ' Vous avez comparé cette courbe de gauss inversée avec ce qui se passait dans d’autres cas. Parce que je suppose que vous connaissez d’autres enseignats de CM2', ' Oui. Oui.', ' Est-ce que vous en avez parlé ? vous avez comparé ?', ' Non J’avoue que non. Mais d’après les résultats qu’on a eu les années précédentes. C’est vrai qu’on n’avait pas cette répartition… Mais je n’avais pas de classe avec une structure aussi particulière.', ' [je reprends la répartition 5/5/13] Et donc, pour ces élèves en grande difficulté, c’est là que vous faîtes des programmes accompagnés ?', ' C’est là qu’il y a ces ateliers… Ces moments d’atelier concernent en fait tous les élèves. Même les élèves qui sont en très grande réussite ont une activité… ils sont en train de travailler sur un exposé, ils travaillent en autonomie et même des élèves qui sont en bonne réussite mais qui ont quand même quelques points… voilà, on en profite. Maintenant pour les élèves qui sont en très très grande difficulté, il y a aussi l’aide personnalisée qui leur est dédiée puis les stages à Pâques.', ' Vous les avez mis en place déjà ? Il y a du monde ?', ' Oui. Enfin, on va les mettre en place à Pâques. Mais oui, ils viendront, j’en ai déjà parlé aux parents.', ' Donc, vous avez restitué les résultats des évaluations aux parents ?', ' Oui. Je les ai rencontrés chacun. Je me suis bloqué un mercredi et puis un samedi pour les rencontrer. Donc un entretien individuel d’une demi-heure à peu près.', ' Individuel.', ' Voilà, individuel. Où je présentais à l’aide du livret rose les résultats des enfants et surtout à partir de là, les points qui seraient retravaillés par la suite dans le cadre de ces ateliers.', ' Comment ils l’ont vécus, les parents, ces évaluations ?', ' C’était assez euh assez étonnant. Il y a certains parents qui rentraient là comme dans un tribunal. C’était étonnant, on les sentait très angoissés par ce moment là… Bon, après, au moment de la discussion… Parce que pendant la réunion de présentation de début d’année j’avais parlé des évaluations nationales et j’avais insisté sur le fait que c’était pas euh pas…', ' Personne n’était hostile ?', ' Non, personne n’était hostile.

difficile de répondre à ça parce que c'est une question que j'ai beaucoup trop réfléchi hein notamment à travers le texte d'Heidegger que tu connais Bâtir Habiter Penser donc je suis très mobilisée par une par une pensée théorique d'abord hein de de l'habiter je peux pas avoir une réponse naïve sur l'habiter\", 'pourquoi ça', \"ben parce que le le si tu veux le texte: d'Heidegger est tellement présent que je ne ferais que: de refaire un cours sur ce que j'ai fait sur Heidegger la semaine dernière bon c'est pas possible que je te réponde comme ça mais ce qui me vient c'est: comme ça comme à la mémoire c'est des flash. euh d'instants . de mon enfance où je me vois dans un lieu (00:02:00) . alors euh je me vois euh dans des lieux qui sont . presque toujours au bord d'être déplaisants euh

été déportés et sont morts et euh un lieu le lieu où je vivais devenu un lieu festif hein ça c'est plutôt heureux tu vois ... dans le grenier de la: maison où vivaient mes parents quand on était réfugiés en Corrèze dans ce grenier y avait simplement une grande valise comme toujours et toujours dans les greniers et là j'y ai trouvé des livres que j'ai lus . avec un rayon de soleil tu sais qui passait à travers la la petite fenêtre le petit fenestron hein de la du grenier (00:04:00) et qui se reflétait sur les grains de poussière tu vois et qu'on appelle des gloires quand c'est dans le ciel tu sais voilà c'est des souvenirs très forts comme ça .. alors ça c'est des lieux: c'est un lieu de refuge où je suis seule et bien tu vois .. c'est c'est des moments comme ça des moments soit de bien-être soit de: situations un peu difficiles hein donc je dirais que: pour essayer d'analyser ça y en a d'autres hein pour essayer d'analyser ça je dirais que c'est: euh c'est du refuge ou c'est du danger c'est un lieu où on est mal ou c'est un lieu où on est bien mais c'est jamais un GRAND lieu c'est un COIN où où où quelque chose de de difficile .\", \"c'est pas les mêmes lieux que tu vois à

CONVIENT hein le le plus c'est comme je te disais c'est des espèces de CREUX hein une descente dans un (00:06:00) creux longer une forêt avec une route qui fait un tour qui aboutit à un bas de vallée euh tu vois une espèce de possibilité de descendre et de monter en en sachant en ayant des repères et ce qui monte trop ce qui ce qui disparaît à l'horizon tu vois tout ce qui pourrait être PERTE euh m'effraie terriblement donc habiter c'est: c'est vraiment être dans un lieu de sécurité tu vois c'est vraiment lié à ça .\", \"le creux c'est xxx\", 'hum hum', \"mais ce que tu dis là. tu le ressens .

veux y a y a les y a des des villes ou les quartiers des morceaux de villes que je connais et où: je suis comme chez moi si tu veux que je vis comme des intériorités euh par exemple je crois que je ne peux pas avoir peur à Paris sauf dans certains quartiers que j'ignore je peux difficilement avoir peur à Paris parce que c'est un lieu FAMILIER et les j'ai (00:08:00) envie de dire familier avec le la connotation famille dedans tu vois espace où il peut rien m'arriver où je vais où s'il m'arrive quelque chose j'ai pas peur parce que je ne suis pas euh dans un lieu étranger tout lieu étranger est étrange et qui dit étrange dit frayeur chez moi d'où bon cette crainte par exemple d'aller euh à l'étranger aller à l'étranger c'est aller dans un espace que je ne connais pas c'est pas le fait que ce soit étranger si tu veux mais que je ne le connaisse pas.. voilà euh . un espace dont je peux prendre la MESURE\", 'mhm .. et où tu as pris la mesure', \"et où j'ai pris la mesure déjà oui\", 'parce que si tu sais que tu peux prendre la mesure ça pourrait provoquer des analogies entre les espaces (difficilement audible)', \"oui peut-être où je retrouve quelque chose que j'ai: oui qui est de

', \"euh dans le Marais d'abord j'y suis née j'y suis née mes parents euh alors c'était très étonnant parce que dans mon souvenir j'y suis née parce que ma mère a dû revenir (00:10:00) dans une clinique euh qui était dans ce quartier-là mais je crois qu'elle l'avait déjà quitté quand je suis née elle est restée pratiquement un an et demi je crois dans le Marais et à l'époque où: de la naissance de mon frère pas de moi et donc le Marais était le lieu où mes parents avaient habité quand ils sont arrivés en France euh rue François Miron et qui était à l'époque un quartier de de de un ghetto juif et un ghetto surtout un quartier de de réfugiés et de migration tu vois et d'immigration et: j- ensuite j'ai vécu à Gentilly donc en banlieue sud et je retournais au Marais avec mes parents pour y acheter de la nourriture juive et on disait aller au Plätzel on va au Plätzel alors aller au Plätzel c'était aller rue des Rosiers et aller notamment chez Klapisch qui est le marchand de poisson un marchand de poisson très connu tout près de la rue des Rosiers sur une petite place dont je ne sais pas le nom là il y a un marchand de poisson que: qui s'appelle Klapisch et qu'on appelait Klapfisch euh pour rire parce que Fisch bon ça veut dire poisson marchand de poisson et alors c'était d'autant plus euh ça été un souvenir pour moi d'autant plus fort qu'ensuite j'ai été au lycée et qu'en sixième j'étais très amie avec la fille euh Klapfisch qui s- qui était scout avec moi et qui s'appelait Jacasse et et voilà et pour moi ce lieu était quand même très investi si tu veux et alors aller au Plätzel c'était donc aller acheter chez Goldenberg ou chez dans des boutiques et souvent pas chez Goldenberg parce que (00:12:00) c'était [\", \"                   [qu'est-ce que ça veut dire Plätzel\", \"Plätzel ça veut dire la place la petite place donc on allait à la petite place donc si tu veux AU lieu quoi LE lieu juif c'était un morceau de un morceau de ghetto euh polonais qui était là exporté: métonymiquement dans dans l'espace parisien et où on RENTRAIT dedans enfin on Y ALLAIT tu vois on rentrait dedans quoi c'était: et mes souvenirs c'était dans ce: chez Klapfisch c'était notamment le grand tonneau euh qui contenait des: cornichons au sel qui étaient là et qui sortaient du du du grand tonneau pour vendre à mes parents des ce qu'on appelait ce qu'on appelle en yiddish des yiguikes ça veut dire des cornichons: tu vois voilà et on achetait des choses bonnes bonnes à manger c'est du bon à manger voilà c'est le lieu où on venait acheter du bon à manger du souvenir de la de la tradition culturelle euh des choses rares et délicieuses et festives. parce qu'on allait acheter ça que de temps en temps on achetait du matsos qui est le pain azyme on achetait euh du du pickelfleich qui est une  qui est une viande de boeuf: bon cuite d'une certaine manière très bonne on y achetait des harengs là aussi souvent au tonneau et dans le tonneau qu'on sortait et que ens- qu'ensuite ma mère épluchait enlevait la la peau et on mangeait ça avec du beurre qui était répandu sur les tranches de pain azyme qui sont en fait (00:14:00) des plaquettes tu vois comme ça voilà c'était c'était un lieu comme ça et puis alors je me souviens qu'on y voyait des juifs religieux qui ont des pattes tu sais les hommes ont des pattes qui sont restées comme ça qui ne sont pas coupées et qu'on appelle des paillesses et alors pour moi c'était un voilà c'était arriver dans la JUIVERIE chose que je ne connaissais pas parce que: à Gentilly on était les seuls on était des des ch- LES chiffonniers de Gentilly mais y en avait d'autres de chiffonniers mais ils étaient pas juifs hein ils étaient souvent euh du Massif Central et nous on était les seuls juifs de Gentilly chiffonniers et donc j'allais dans un lieu qui était le lieu de la juiverie euh dont j'étais séparée le plus souvent tu vois et que je ne connaissais que comme ça pour moi être juif c'était être chiffonnier et aller chercher des yiguikes au Plätzel quoi c'était ça c'est-à-dire que c'était un peu la honte hein. d'une bouffe qu'on aimait mais qui était traditionnelle mais qui était pas la la bouffe des goy quoi et puis euh et puis faire un métier infâme \", \"et tu mets les deux sur le même: c'est la même honte\", \"ah oui dans mon dans mon dans mon mon imaginaire enfantin c'était la même chose. c'était des paumés quoi c'était\", 'mais en même temps avec un plaisir de: de cette nourriture de cette fête', \"oui parce que ma mère est une cuisinière hors pair une très très bonne cuisinière et c'était toujours très valorisé dans ma famille c'était la la la chose qu'elle savait faire c'était là qu'elle nous DIRIGEAIT nous c'est LÀ qu'elle TRÔNAIT si tu veux dans la salle à manger debout en servant debout jamais une assiette devant sa (00:16:00) chaise euh parce que elle finissait les plats et et et elle ne mangeait que dans les plats et elle nous servait je elle nous servait d'une manière AUTORITAIRE pas comme une servante elle servait en disant MANGE. n'est-ce pas TAIS-TOI MANGE tu vois c'était vraiment: le lieu son autorité totale qui s'exerçait là. et puis elle allait aussi acheter des CARPES vivantes qu'elle mettait dans une bassine pour faire de la carpe farcie. et alors on allait acheter la carpe au Plätzel on la ramenait on la mettait dans la bassine j'admirais le poisson qui qui nageait dans la bassine et je savais après que ma mère allait opérer un MEURTRE c'est-à-dire qu'elle allait prendre le poisson et lui couper la tête et pour moi ma mère était un assassin. qui tuait les bêtes avec le plaisir de cuisinière c'était un être cruel dont on était médusé mon petit-frère et moi de de cet acte rituel de mort qu'elle exerçait sur le poisson et après on bouffait le poisson farci avec un plaisir sans mélange tout en étant euh euh extrêmement choqués par sa violence et le meurtre qu'elle avait opéré avant mais enfin ça ne nous a jamais empêché de bouffer tu vois voilà euh. donc si tu veux c'est un c'est un morceau de c'est un morceau d'identité honteuse c'est un espace de: c'est un espace: où je retrouvais des gens qui étaient comme moi. mais un un comme moi . un comme moi de la honte (00:18:00) .. alors bon ça c'est un des souvenirs le deuxième souvenir c'est que euh on allait très souvent voir des amis une famille entière mais ça c'est après guerre hein dont le père avait été déporté et c'est lui qui a accompagné mon oncle euh à la chambre à gaz ce monsieur qui sifflait très bien et comme dans l'orchestre d'Auschwitz à l'époque où il y était il n'y avait plus de flûtes comme il sifflait très bien c'est lui qui remplaçait la flûte dans l'orchestre et cet homme quand tu rentrais chez lui dans un appartement qui était situé dans une des cours d'un des: palais du: du Marais mais complètement envahi par des petits artisans des gens qui fabriquaient notamment en série euh des cotonnades ou des tissus: pour du prêt-à-porter pour des choses comme ça lui il fabriquait des pull-overs. et il et il y avait donc des machines incroyables dans des dans des lieux splendides qui étaient recouverts de toiles repeints  tu voix complètement réaménagés et donc extrêmement petits et sombres et on rentrait et dans l'entrée sur un porte-manteau de couturière y avait son habit de déporté. et on allait les voir et on allait le voir il s'était remarié parce qu'il avait perdu toute sa famille il s'était remarié il avait des enfants et on allait le voir et donc pour moi le Plätzel c'était aussi un lieu: sale laid sombre mais où on fabriquait des choses euh que ma mère euh achetait à bon marché moins (00:20:00) cher euh des beaux pull-overs des choses comme ça tu vois que je le voyait fabriquer avec des machines tu vois des tricoteuses des machins comme ça y avait toujours l'espace du Marais pour moi c'est des machines à coudre . euh utilisées par des hommes c'est les hommes qui travaillent sur les ces machines à coudre là ce sont des mécaniciens qui sont mieux payés que les femmes et qui font de la de la du prêt-à-porter de la série. et: c'est pas les femmes hein qui: pour moi c'est pas attaché au féminin tu vois tout tout ce travail d'aiguille enfin tu vois est un travail d'homme .\", \"au début de Gentilly c'est comme si en fait c'était une espèce de lieu de centre où tu retournais \", ': oui oui oui', \"y avait d'autres lieux où\", \"où je retournais comme ça non de Gentilly euh de Gentilly euh.. si y a eu mais beaucoup plus tard quand j'ai été étudiante y a eu le Quartier Latin que j'avais complètement investi d'autant que euh. une jeune femme qui a énormément enfin qui était jeune à l'époque qui a beaucoup compté dans ma vie parce qu'elle avait à peu près l'âge de mon frère et elle ét- sa mère était du même village ou d'un village voisin de chez mes parents et ses parents ont été déportés enfin bon c'est toute une histoire que je ne peux pas raconter là mais mon père l'a retrouvée après guerre et donc elle venait régulièrement chez moi. et c'était l'occasion pour ma mère pour lui donner à bouffer parce que elle avait rien plus de parents plus rien et c'était une espèce de cousine à la mode de Bretagne que j'adorais que j'aimais beaucoup qui a qui je crois (00:22:00) a compté d'une manière incroyable dans ma vie et elle habitait dans le quartier Latin rue de: rue de la Harpe. et donc: voilà c'est un deuxième lieu tout à fait central j'allais la voir et ensuite je suis devenue étudiante à la Sorbonne et à l'Institut de Géographie et: donc je retournais au Quartier Latin et c'était vraiment mon quartier le Quartier Latin d'autant que je t'ai raconté la première manifestation à laquelle j'ai assisté j'avais quatorze ans ça se passait au Quartier Latin et puis c'était aussi le lieu où mon frère faisait ses études et où il était militant et mon frère bon pour moi était un espèce de père pour moi hein. puis il était beaucoup plus âgé que moi et il savait lire et écrire donc c'est lui qui pouvait: qui avait la fonction paternelle donc c'était un lieu très investi un lieu de la culture un lieu de: où étaient mes véritables parents c'est-à-dire cette

toutes ses voisines à Gentilly que je vais y faire le trottoir (00:24:00)  je vais pas y faire mes études je vais y faire le TROTTOIR donc c'est en plus c'est un lieu euh hyper sexué euh parce que euh quand j'ai rencontré Bourdieu enfin bon enfin j'ét- j'habitais rue d'xxx il a il a été d'abord à Louis Le Grand et puis à rue d'xxx tout ça était au Quartier Latin et et donc c'est là que sont mes

ne vont jamais. donc:. c'est un lieu de liberté c'est un lieu de liberté: c'est une sauveté presque tu vois (tout le passage très bas très grave) le Quartier Latin. où je vais dans les bistrots travailler où j` vais aux cinémas avec mon frère j'ai des souvenirs comme ça on allait à deux ou trois séances successives et on se disait il faudra jamais le dire aux parents et on allait au cinéma AU QUARTIER LATIN la première fois que je vais au cinéma c'est voir Les Enfants du paradis avec cette femme dont je t'ai parlé y a un instant Fanny et qui euh m'initie au ciné- au cinéma AU VRAI parce que sinon j'allais au cinéma à Gentilly avant guerre voir tous les films de Shirley Temple et les films de Tarzan et Blanche-Neige et ça j'y vais régulièrement pour apprendre à faire mes claquettes en voyant les films de Shirley Temple  puis Fred Aster les comédies musicales Tarzan et Blanche-Neige mais le VRAI cinéma le cinéma de culture si tu veux euh je l'ai vu grâce à Fanny au Quartier Latin où elle m'a emmenée où elle vit elle avec: son compagnon\", \"là c'est c'est vraiment une opposition d'époques y a peu de: parallèles (00:26:00) entre le quartier du Prätzel\", 'le Plätzel', 'le Plätzel et le Quartier Latin xxx', 'non [aucun aucun', '     [xxx ', 'complètement complètement', 'tu retournais plus', \"oui je retournais plus si (voix montante) j'allais quelque fois au Plätzel avec mes parents comme maintenant quand je vais chez mes parents je leur je téléphone et je dis tu veux que je te ramène quelque chose du Plätzel alors elle me dit oui tu m’achètes elle me dit ce qu'elle veut et je vais faire un petit tour au Plätzel pour quand je vais chez mes parents pour leur ramener la nourriture tu vois donc c'est un lieu que je continue à fréquenter mais qui est complètement maternel nourricier euh voilà alors c'est un quartier nourricier c'est un quartier pass- du passé un peu de la honte tandis que le Quartier Latin euh c'est le quartier de la culture c'est le quartier où moi j'ai droit de vivre où j'ai le droit en tant que femme y a des étudiantes tu vois et puis y a Gentilly Gentilly c'est euh .. c'est le lieu où j'ai été élevée euh c'est le lieu euh où mes parents sont chiffonniers euh euh où je vais à l'école honteuse parce que je suis fille de chiffonnier que je suis habillée comme un cochon et où j'ai honte c'est la ville où je vais faire mes courses et je ma mère me hurle dessus parce que j'ai jamais acheté ce qu'il fallait correctement euh . c'est le quartier je joue avec mon frère et où mon frère me traîne partout parce que ma mère euh bon c'est mon frère qui m'élève et il me traîne sur sur les terrains de football quand il va faire euh j` sais pas quoi et puis on a des traîneaux tu sais à roues pour descendre la rue Jean Jaurès qui descend à pic (00:28:00) et où je joue mais complètement investie par mon frère. qui me paterne complètement je peux pas faire un pas sans lui il me bat il me il me fait participer à tous ses jeux euh et je suis avec lui et c'est une ville immonde la Bièvre est un égout ouvert et qui a été refermé beau- bien après y a sept tanneries dans la rue ça pue effroyablement sauf le jour où le marchand de biscuits fait ses biscuits c'est pas un marchand c'est un: il fabrique des cakes et alors là la ville est envahie par l'odeur du cake mais quand lui ne fait y a pas de cake c'est l'odeur des peaux qui sèchent sur des claies immenses claies en bois dans toute la rue c'est la pauvreté et la saleté tu vois alors mes parents sont chiffonniers et y a des peaux de lapin partout y a des rats y a des puces et y a l'odeur de grésil. et une résistance à la saleté insensée. et: et voilà et je vis dans une maison qui est: laide euh qui ouvre sur un magasin immonde et euh . y a pas de place je dors sur un lit-cage dans la salle à manger quand tout le monde est parti je fais mes devoirs sur un réchaud à gaz dont on baisse le le battant en mettant un journal dessus pour que je fasse mes devoirs euh je me lave sur l'évier parce que je y a pas d'autre endroit et toujours en gueulant qu'il faut pas rentrer pour que je puisse me laver donc je me lave par petits bouts et aussi dans la honte de montrer mon corps et: (00:30:00)  et où je n'ai j- pas de lieu à moi puis à la libération j'en ai un parce qu'ils ont repris le premier étage qu'ils avaient passé à des gens qui n'avaient plus rien et où d'un seul coup j'ai une petite chambre mais elle est à côté de chez mes parents pour accéder à la chambre de mes parents il faut passer par ma chambre et on entend tout donc je n'ai j'ai pas de lieu de refuge j'ai pas de lieu à moi au point que quand je voulais me cacher même jusqu'à quand je passais le bac tu vois jusqu'à quinze seize ans quand je voulais me cacher de ma mère euh il y avait un canapé qui prenait . le coin du salon en triangle et je me cachais derrière donc c'était un coin minuscule où jusqu'à seize ans je me cachais là tranquille pour pouvoir lire parce que ma mère ne supportait pas que j'aie une activité intellectuelle elle voulait m'emmerder et alors VA répondre au téléphone QU'EST-CE QUE tu fous TU ferais mieux d'aller laver ton linge QUI c'est qui a fait la vaisselle je ne peux pas euh être tranquille à à lire ou à travailler c'est pas possible et souvent quand elle me voit à ma table elle monte avec une chaise et elle s'assied à côté de moi et elle respire très fort et elle me regarde mais c'est un regard d'aveugle puisqu'elle sait pas lire tu vois et elle me regarde puis au bout de trois minutes tu veux pas que je te fasse un thé tu veux pas etc elle peut pas supporter. euh ou alors on nous donne des cours de piano et alors pour faire bien hein j'essaie de faire la gamme et elle hurle tu peux pas fermer en yiddish ça veut dire ce bruit tu peux pas fermer ce Pierdelick alors il faut bien que je m'exerce je peux jamais donc je fais du piano sans pouvoir jamais m'exercer (00:32:00) et en même temps si tu veux c'est ça doit complètement alimenter la difficulté que j'ai moi-même à me concentrer tu vois à la fois c'est ça devient une boucle parce que je n'ai pas à me concentrer puisque je sais très bien que de toute façon elle m'empêchera de le faire. et donc une une incapacité une impossibilité à m’isoler. euh et certainement du coup une TERREUR d'être seule puisque je j'ai jamais pu le faire jamais. alors par contre quand j'étais en Corrèze euh je me promène beaucoup dans la campagne toute seule. comme: et ça étonne tout le monde qu'une petite fille comme ça parte euh et j'ai un petit carnet et j'écris des poèmes que j'ai conservés que j'ai écrits à dès que j'ai su lire et écrire j'ai été à l'école très très tard parce que ma mère m'a mise très très tard à l'école parce qu'à l'école maternelle je voulais pas y aller parce que je me faisais insulter donc voilà voilà hein faut pas\", 'insulter par qui', 'par les gosses', 'parce que:', \"parce que j'étais fille de chiffonnier et que j'étais mal habillée. j'étais habillée comme un xxx passons j` sais pas non je peux parler de ça là c'est pas po- c'est pas c'est pas le problème si tu veux... voilà alors c'est Gentilly c'est c'est un lieu tu vois c'est un lieu où à la fois où j'ai peur parce que euh .. quelque fois elle m'envoie dans un endroit qu'on appelle des logis où on a mis des des réfugiés de la guerre 14 et qui en fait est un repère de petits voyous et où là quand même je suis quand même trop bien habillée pour eux parce que eux c'est vraiment des pauvres bien plus que moi et j'ose pas y aller et c'est un lieu très effrayant (00:34:00) aussi quand ma mère m'y envoie j'ai peur et puis y a le château (ton montant) le château de la Reine Blanche qui a appartenu à la mère de Saint-Louis et qui est là en train de crever et où on va jouer de temps en temps avec les enfants et où on vit dans la trouille de tomber dans les oubliettes parce qu'on sait qu'y a des trous et qu'y avait des oubliettes effectivement et il a été détruit depuis fort longtemps  on y allait après guerre tu vois on y allait encore jouer.. mais: en fait ma mère m'a toujours mis en nourrice tu vois ce qui fait que euh j'ai été beaucoup en nourrice et: et en nourrice je suis mal parce que j'y vais avec le fils de la teinturière d'à côté et il est blond il a les yeux bleus c'est un petit goy et c'est le fils de: on va chez sa marraine donc sa marraine le préfère et moi je suis l'enfant dont on . tu vois à qui on dit ah mais toi le père Noël t` es une juive tu sais pas ce que c'est que le père Noël tu vois donc j'y suis mal toujours là c'est des lieux où je suis euh . voilà\", \"donc Gentilly c'est HORS c'est pas un lieu c'est un lieu de malaise\", \"c'est: c'est à c'est à la fois un lieu où: si parce que par exemple dans la salle à manger j'ai des souvenirs insensés où mon frère et mon père euh jouaient avec moi j'étais toute petite tu vois et je me souviens qu'ils jouaient avec moi de chaque côté de la table comme si j'avais été une balle au ballon ils se ils ils me lancent au-dessus de la table la table est mise ma mère hurle mais elle va tomber sur la table ils me lancent comme ça et alors j'éprouve des joies insensées à être un objet (00:36:00)  entre les deux hommes de la maison pour moi si tu veux voilà alors là c'est une joie absolue ou alors y a une glace et on fait des claquettes avec mon frère. alors là aussi c'est la joie absolue parce que parce que je danse très bien mon frère aus- aussi et on monte notre numéro de danse et on se marre comme des baleines tu vois et puis j'ai aussi le souvenir de sauter à la corde avec ma mère sur le trottoir à Gentilly on jou- on sautait à la corde parce que avant guerre euh on sortait les chaises le soir et on restait sur les trottoirs donc la rue était un lieu hein ce qu'elle n'est plus du tout bien sûr y a que: des crottes de chien mais c'est un lieu alors des des les soirs d'été tombant tu vois avec la fraîcheur qui descend et moi en train de jouer de sauter à la corde avec ma mère. ou alors il faisait tellement chaud qu'on montait à Bicêtre qui était en haut et là on voyait tout Paris du haut de Bicêtre et on pique-nique dans des dans des espèces de terrains vagues immondes mais ça fait rien c'est le soir et on voit tout Paris éclairé donc c'est pas si vrai tu vois c'est . c'est .. bon et même l'en- même le magasin de chiffons est un lieu incroyable qui pue qui est dégueulasse qui: mais où il se passe des choses insensées insensées tu vois y a des ouvriers qui sont là qui trient des vieux chiffons euh bon c'est c'est c’est à la fois comment dire . c'est à la fois des lieux de de GRANDE joie par éclats tu vois par éclats par euh par moments euh où alors y a la chambre de mes parents où y a (00:38:00) où trône sur la sur le lit de mes parents une espèce de poupée en porcelaine avec tu sais une robe qu'on étalait toute en soie et qui était pour moi le lieu le plus beau qui soit au monde tu vois euh un lieu de beauté absolue tu vois la chambre de mes parents c'était BEAU et on y entrait jamais (très très bas chuchoté) où vraiment avec un grand respect et puis où il y a un dessus de lit très fin enfin tout y est beau (plus haut:) tandis que moi j'ai pas de lit j'ai pas de chambre j'ai tu vois j'ai rien donc ça c'est un lieu puis y a la boîte à chaussures que je construis comme ça qui est aussi un un petit lieu où je reconstruis où je reconstruis un un lieu puisque je n'en ai pas mais malheureusement je il y enfin on a fui les allemands et j'ai laissé la boîte à chaussures non finie non terminée enfin tu vois et voilà donc c'est c'est plus ambigu que cela c'est: mais enfin Fanny qui m'a vu justement en Pologne Fanny qui m'a vue en Pologne m'a raconté mais très dernièrement y a un je ne savais pas que elle disait tout le temps à sa maman mais qu'est-ce qu'elle a cette petite fille elle pleure tout le temps c'est-à-dire que je suis quelqu'un qui pleure tout le temps qui a des maux de tête à hurler alors là aussi c'est un moment ça me vient tu vois je suis dans la salle à manger je hurle de douleur et mon père à ce moment là prend un gant qu'il trempe dans du vinaigre parce que ça tient ça fait froid et il me le met sur la tête et il me caresse la tête et ça se passe dans cette pièce ou alors y a un autre souvenir (00:40:00) où y a des des rideaux avec des dessins qui représentent des fleurs je trouve ces fleurs tellement belles que je veux les cueillir alors je prends les ciseaux et je découpe les fleurs et quand je découpe les fleurs je me rends compte que ça fabrique des trous de découper les fleurs qu'on peut pas les couper ça fait des trous et alors je suis prise de terreur parce que je sais que je vais ramasser une raclée pas possible et ça se passe aussi dans cette salle à manger qui maintenant à été détruite y a un mois je toute la maison a été détruite \", 'ils habitaient toujours là tes parents', 'oui ils habitaient toujours là', \"et c'est eux qui ont voulu que ça soit détruit \", 'non non parce que ça a sauté enfin tout cela est bien loin du Marais', \"mais parce que tout ce que tu dis des lieux où tu habitais tu as parlé du Marais comme d'un lieu où tu habitais \", \"non c'est pas un lieu où j'habitais c'est un lieu où je suis née et mes parents ont habité alors mes parents eux ont habité rue François Miron. ils étaient repasseurs de nuit tu vois parce que à l'époque on repassait avec d'énormes fers dans le dans lesquels on mettait du charbon de bois euh chaud et et les ouvriers immigrés clandestins repassaient la nuit pendant que les ouvriers français repassaient le jour et ils ils avaient loué une petite chambre près du grenier sans eau sans électr- peut-être avec les l'électricité mais sans eau et ils se sont installés là-dedans avec la vaisselle sous le lit enfin absolument minuscule et mon frère y est né et c'est là que voyant Janovici chiffonier avec une voiture à bras tirant la la voiture à bras euh en en gueulant marchand d'habits chiffons ils ont eu l'idée de faire comme lui et ils ont commencé comme ça (00:42:00) et quand ils ont eu suffisamment de de fric ils sont partis donc ça a duré que quelques années ils sont partis à Gentilly et j'ai vu un film qui est passé à la télévision je crois la semaine dernière où y a on montre le Plätzel à cette époque et j'ai vu plein de voitures à bras et vraiment ç` aurait pu être mon père et ma mère quoi tu vois c'était des chiffonniers passaient ramassaient la voiture à bras était quelque chose qu'on utilisait très fort donc\", 'et pourquoi ils habitaient là ', 'ah ben les juifs habitaient là', \"oui mais beaucoup de de chiffonniers étaient juifs à l'époque où c'est les juifs qui passaient par là ou c'est les chiffonniers qui passaient pas là\", 'ben les chiffonniers si tu veux ils devaient tous faire comme ça quoi ils devaient commencer [ ', '                             [xxx', \"en allant en partant de du du Marais donc du Plätzel ça s'appelait pas le Marais tu vois ça s'appelait je crois pas ça s'appelait le Plätzel ils partaient là parce qu'ils y habitaient ils allaient dans tout Paris en gueulant marchand d'habit chiffon le quartier où mon père gueulait comme ça il m'a raconté c'était du côté de Montparnasse parce qu'ils se partageaient les quartiers et puis ils revenaient et quand ils ont eu suffi- trop de qu'ils ont eu que ça a bien marché ils ont eu de quoi louer un magasin à Gentilly et s'en aller définitivement donc c'était un point de départ puis après dès qui ils ils réussissaient ils s'en allaient et c'était un moyen de s'intégrer si tu veux et ils s'en allaient dans des lieux où on acceptait des chiffonniers c'est-à-dire dans des banlieues ouvrières pauvres prolétaires tu vois \", \"le Plätzel c'était où et comment\", \"c'était en gros pour moi c'était la rue des Rosiers et puis cette petite place qui est attenante à la rue des Rosiers dont je ne sais pas le nom euh qui est tout près d'une synagogue là de la synagogue (00:44:00) de la rue des Ro- de la rue de je ne sais pas de quelle rue ça s'appelle et et le et le le marchand de de Klapfisch le marchand de poisson tu vois c'est: pour moi dans mon dans mon souvenir d'enfance c'est absolument minuscule c'est minuscule ça fait j` sais pas ça fait même pas cent mètres c'est minuscule\", 'donc ça a pas tellement de sens de penser au Marais ', \"non non non. en même temps euh si tu veux je sais que c'est des j'ai su après parce que j'ai fait mes études si tu veux j'ai su après que c'était un quartier royal que bon je l'ai su particulièrement puisque j'ai fait une licence d'histoire donc j'ai su et puis j'ai vu Le dernier des justes donc euh comment te dire ce quartier a été aussi investi par la littérature euh . mais euh . c'est bi- bien après c'est bien après que j'ai su que c'était le Marais et puis parce que j'ai connu Zeitoun qui habitait place des Vosges et que que j'ai j'ai vu j'ai été complètement étonnée de voir que dans le fond la place des Vosges et le Marais c'était si près de ce quartier là. parce qu'il y avait le versant noble et le versant pauvre et que la barrière pour moi était infran- je l'avais jamais franchie en fait je savais pas que c'était près je ne savais pas tu vois y avait le quartier pouilleux et puis le quartier d'histoire et il m'a fallu j` sais pas peut-être avoir vingt ans pour savoir que c'était si proche puisque j'habitais Gentilly je connaissais mal Paris tu vois Paris pour moi c'était quelques îlots quelques images i- isolées et la place des Vosges j'avais appris en histoire la place des Vosges (voix riante) et je j'avais été voir la place des Vosges la place des Vosges était aussi loin du Plätzel que que l'est j` sais pas (00:46:00) Versailles de de de la rue de Mxxx en Pologne tu vois à peu près la rue des juifs de Mxxx en Pologne \", '46:09)', '46:11)', \"que je devienne: bien plus âgée que je fasse des études que je sois que je connaisse bon Gaudibert qui m'a amenée au musée je crois que c'est le musée Carnavalet qui est là-bas pour pour . (voix très basse) pour que si tu veux je fasse des LIENS mais c'était des liens SAVANTS c'était un lien savant c'est pas c'est pas imaginairement c- c'est deux mondes y a le Marais et puis y a le Plätzel ...\", \"et quand est-ce que tu l'appelles toujours le Plätzel quand même\", \"non je l'appelle le Plätzel pour jouer quand je dis à ma mère tu veux que j'aille au Plätzel ou pour jouer avec mon fils on va au Plätzel ce soir mais: ou bouffer tu vois bouffer mais NON non non maintenant je dis le Marais .. je dis le Marais d'autant qu'il est en train de changer d'une manière. totale et il est en train de devenir un lieu snobinard et exotique et puis voilà quoi. complètement changé\", \"c'est récent ce phénomène\", \"alors ça c'est tout à fait récent par exemple y a seulement un mois je vais chez Goldenberg acheter à bouffer avec mon frère pour mes parents et: euh mon frère sait pas bien dire alors moi je vais et puis je dis à la serveuse qui avait l'air d'une belle suédoise je lui dis: je veux du Pickelfleich un petit bout des yiguikes enfin je parle comme ça et je vois une femme avec son mari qui avait mon âge qui avaient ils avaient l'air d'intellectuels et qui (00:48:00) me regardent. complètement ÉNAMOURÉS tu vois énamourés enfin comme si j'étais: d'un seul coup j'ai compris que j'étais INVESTIE symboliquement et affectivement j'étais LA culture juive en personne.. parce que je parlais en u- en utilisant des termes yiddish et d'un seul coup j'ai com- j'étais une juive pour les autres alors que c'est des mots que DIS mais en fait je suis incapable de parler yiddish tu vois donc: et j'étais j'étais j'étais juive pour eux. et du coup je le devenais pour moi puisque je l'étais pour eux tu vois c'est ce qui m'est arrivé avec David je suis devenue juive avec David moi. parce que parce que: il il était tellement complètement é- ébahi de ce que racontais.. et d'un que d'un seul coup ce que je racontais devenait un fait culturel et et entrait dans l'ordre symbolique alors qu'avant ce n'était que un récit de de d'immigrée pouilleuse et honteuse et de quelqu'un qui n'avait p- qui n'avait qu'à à raconter d'elle que sa vie puisqu'elle n'avait pas de terre puisqu'elle n'avait pas de [\", \"c'est ce que tu nous disais tout à l'heure \", \"oui. puisque je n'ai pas puisque je n'ai pas de terre puisque je n'ai pas de lieu je ne peux que raconter ma vie. et en fait je ne peux que ra- le le bon beaucoup de juifs le disent ça mon cousin Dreyfuss dit euh mon territoire c'est la nourriture c'est la nourriture que faisait ma mère. et c'est nos territoires si tu veux parce que c'est ça euh l'errance si tu veux. l'errance c'est c'est eh pour moi y a y a bon ça là je parle d'une manière savante comme je comme je dirais à mes étudiants hein pour moi bon y a certainement des gens qui vident (00:50:00) qui vivent leur territoire sur sur le mode de l'inscription territoriale de type euh euh féodal hein tu es d'où. d'où tu es tu es d'où tu es euh bon c'est Heidegger le le dit d'une manière FAUSSE avec des allusions euh si tu veux linguistiques et des des des tentatives d'analyses linguistiques qui tiennent pas debout mais ce qu'il dit est JUSTE tu es d'où tu es et et c'est pas je pense donc je suis mais je je suis d'un territoire donc je suis quoi d'où je suis je suis hein euh alors y a y a les gens qui vivent comme ça bon et c'est la la territorialité telle que ce euh et et telle que s- comment dire toute l'identité et le discours sur l'identité contemporaine fonctionne sur cette idéologie là hein sur cet imaginaire là\", 'xxx', \"oui mais c'est l'imaginaire territorial féodal à mon avis hein euh: c'est euh. on est d'un lieu xxx et puis alors c'est d'autant plus ambigu que les juifs aussi ont des noms de lieux ce qui est ce qui est d'une d'une folie puisqu'en fait ils ne sont d'aucun lieu or on les appelle Montauban euh SMOLENSKY c'est-à-dire habitant de SMOLENSK euh voilà alors qu'ils ne sont d'aucun lieu ce qui est ce qui est inimaginable mais on comprend puisqu'au moyen-âge les noms de villes les villes étaient des lieux de sauveté étaient des sauvetés donc les g- les hommes sans appartenance territoriale pouvaient se revendiquer d'un SEUL endroit qui était la ville et la ville était dans le fond le NON LIEU de de la de la territorialité féodale c'était le lieu (00:52:00) mobile hein le lieu on l'on pouvait être d'aucun lieu et c'est c'est c'est pour MOI euh si tu veux bon je l'écrirai ce que je suis en train de te dire c'est pour moi l'essence même de la ville l'essence de la ville c'est la déterritorialisation ce qui fait que toute la pensée du quartier etc elle est là mais c'est pas ça l'importance c'est vraiment pas ça l'importance de ce que signifie la ville la ville c'est le lieu de la migration c'est le lieu du mouvement c'est le lieu de la mobilité c'est le lieu comme bon comme je le dis aux étudiants où où l'a- où l'ailleurs est est est complètement présent dans le COEUR hein au coeur du dedans le le dedans et le le le plus dedans d'un lieu qu'est la ville est le est un dehors si tu veux hein bon alors c'est pour ça que les juifs ont toujours des noms de lieux mais c'est des noms de VILLES des noms de villages des noms des noms de CARREFOURS enfin si tu veux hein de de mobilité\", 'les villes dans leur mobilité', \"voilà donc ça c'est c'est enfin la ville c'est la mobilité toujours hein pour moi toujours c'est ça sa définition hein c'est ça sa définition la sauveté le château fort c'est là où où on va se réfugier mais c'est c'est là où on où on est plus liés à la terre hein bon tou- toute la pensée féodale est construite là-dessus enfin je crois hein très très fort ça mais bon j'ai écrit je te passerai peut-être ce que j'ai écrit là sur les sur les villes du moyen-âge bon ça été lu par des historiens et c'est et c'est ce je crois que c'est bien ce que je dis là tu vois c'est c'est juste quoi et c'est très important je crois pour comprendre ce que c'est qu'une ville et: . bon alors tout ça pour te dire que: voilà une forme d'identité totalement paradoxale alors y a l'identité de l'en- de l'in- de l'enracinement enfin terme dont j'ai (00:54:00) horreur mais mais qui qui dit bien ce qu'il veut dire qui est qui est le cerf en fait quoi qui est la filiation du servage hein et puis tu as l'identité urbaine qui est au contraire la sauveté tu es de ce lieu parce que tu peux t’y réfugier puisque tu es de nulle part tu es tu es SAUVÉ hein là c'est là que tu es sauvé de ta fuite hein de la fuite hein c'est là où tu es PLANQUÉ quoi hein et: et moi t` as vu mes lieux c'est ça c'est des lieux refuge hein et puis tu as les nomades mais les nomades pour moi c'est et pour tout le monde je pense qui réfléchit à ça c'est des . gens où l'espace est PARCOURS mais y a rien de plus stable qu'un parcours c'est fabriqué d'images le parcours lui il est stable c'est toi qui le: qui est mobile DANS l'espace fixe tu comprends donc d'ailleurs ils ont des itinéraires ils vont pas n'importe où euh c'est c'est extrêmement euh construit euh ils ont des espaces ils peuvent s'inves- investir des lieux se se dire je suis allé là en telle année et et un tel enfant est né à tel endroit telle fête on on va aller la fêter là et j'ai un de mes étudiants qui m'a raconté que dans le désert je sais plus quelle peuplade pratiquait une fête où ils s- ils viennent de partout c'est des nomades et ils construisent une ville avec des tentes pratiquement en une nuit complètement codée et stabilisée ils y restent deux trois jours et ils la redétruisent en repartant donc y a y a rien de plus codé qu'un espace comme ça ou Mircea Eliade quand il raconte l'histoire de ce peuple ou de cette ethnie qui se ballade avec un bâton qui est leur axis mundi et quand ils arrivent dans un (00:56:00) lieu ils ont toujours ce bâton et y a tout un cérémonial et un rituel pour repérer pour qui joue avec le nord le sud enfin etc tu vois pour savoir où ils doivent mettre leur tente et une fois qu'ils ont trouvé tout tout le système ils s'implantent hein au sens fort du terme ils s'implantent et là ils savent comment organiser l'espace et c'est extrêmement construit symboliquement et si tu leur pique leur bâton ils sont foutus. ils savent absolument plus se repérer et ils peuvent plus se déambuler dans l'espace. tu vois c'est parce que c'est un c'est un c'est un bon ce bâton a une a une une tel- telle force symbolique c'est c'est ce qui joint le ciel et la terre. et et le ciel et les le monde des hommes des vivants et des morts comme dirait Heidegger et des et des et des . et des vivants et tu vois et du ciel et de la terre que ils sont complètement foutus Mircea Eliade dé- décrit ça de manière merveilleuse tu vois donc c'est c'est des espaces construits donc c'est des espaces qui symboliquement imaginairement euh sont sont tout à fait repérables et localisables ce sont des lieux hein une fois que le bâton est là on sait où on est le monde commence à tourner autour de ça tu vois euh donc y a de l'identité parce qu'il y a de l'identification possible. et tant que tu es là-dedans tu t'en sors y a pas y a aucun problème alors pour moi y a y a y a ce qui est sans lieu sans lieu c'est-à-dire privatif pas s-e-n-t mais qui n'a pas qui est sans lieu qui est L'IRREPÉRABLE qui est l'irrepérable qui est la perte. qui est la fuite qui est qui est qui est la terreur absolue et qui à mon avis est ce qui m'habite. ce qui m'habite fondamentalement et (00:58:00) bon et c'est et c'est pas pour rien que les psychanalystes . euh\", \"qui habite mais c'est peut-être pas ce que TU habites c'est une différence non mais c'est tu as bien dit ce qui m'habite\", 'ben ce qui ce qui', 'ce que tu viens de me dire avant ', 'mhm', \"tu me parlais d'habiter difficile mais [pas\", \"                                       [ce qui m'habite ce qui m'habite c'est un espace terrorisant parce qu'irrepérable irrepérable innommable incernable euh.. ce que moi je peux habiter c'est les lieux clos les lieux : bon je peux je peux dire et je peux pas ne pas reconnaître que ce sont des lieux: si tu veux des des refuges qui sont des refuges enfin qui sont alors ça peut être la ville comme ça peut être une chambre ça peut être un grand espace tu vois j'ai écrit un texte que j'ai mis en en exergue à un de mes chapitres de l'Imaginaire Bâtisseur que tu as là-haut c'est un poème qui est pas signé personne ne repère qu'il est de moi où je parle de la ville et où je termine et je parle de Paris et je termine en disant ma ville mon oreiller c'est-à-dire que c'est mon lit tu vois c'est c'est vraiment bon je je n'ai pas peur à Paris parce que c'est un lieu qui qui est qui est qui est repérable qui est repérable \", 'mais pourquoi dis-tu alors que le le sans-lieu t’habite', \"et le sans-lieu m'habite voilà ... ben parce que je p- bon c'est une banalité des que les psychanalystes connaissent bien enfin. l'identité d'un être humain elle se construit elle à travers sa capacité à se con- à construire son corps comme un territoire et à (01:00:00) savoir bon jouer d'une projection très: extérieure et intérieure et tant que je ne m'habiterai pas tant que euh le sans-lieu m'habitera je ne pourrai pas habiter conquérir les milieux extérieurs. hein ça c'est c'est c'est pas possible je ne peux pas partir à la conquête tu vois je ne peux pas partir à la conquête puisque je suis un complètement euh en comment dire en SYMBIOSE avec l'espace extérieur j'ai pas de frontière les espaces ont des frontières c'est c'est la (frousse?) totale.. alors peut-être parce que j'ai franchi des frontières clandestinement. puisque j'ai passé la ligne de démarcation puisque ma mère est venue en France toute seule . euh dans une peur absolue puisque mon père est par- passé clandestinement de la Pologne à la France sans carte d'identité et que mon père est un est un immigré clandestin qui s'est fait acheter une carte . que donc on est des gens à identité clandestine qu'en plus mon nom n'est pas exactement celui de mes parents comme j'ai dû te le dire enfin bon je crois que du point de vue psychanalytique c'est enfantin c'est clair comme de l'eau de roche tu vois c'est pas le problème mais . voilà alors pour revenir au Marais \", '[mais', \"[certainement ce qui me plaît dans le travail que je suis en train de de mener et ça s'est fait complètement simplement c'est par hasard presque mais ce qui me plaît beaucoup c'est que d'un seul coup je me suis surprise moi-même en train de redonner des lettres de noblesse à à une un espace honteux puisque: ce Marais est un est un palais royal hein tu vois est un LIEU royal (01:02:00)  enfin c'est pas un palais royal c'est un lieu qui qui a été royal . euh qu'en plus a été valorisé après coup par par l'écriture yiddish puisque j'ai appris après que y a avait de grands écrivains (qu'il pouvaitqui pouvaient) même avoir des prix Nobel que: que ce lieu est en train d'être d'être survalorisé.. et que: moi-même je suis en train de l'étudier avec des chercheurs qui acceptent de de travailler sur sur dans le lieu ou je suis née. et que et que si tu veux je ça fait un an que je suis en train de faire un truc qui est INCROYABLE je sais pas si tu te rends compte et je me suis SURPRISE en train de le faire. parce que j'ai toujours travaillé sur des choses différentes de ce que j'aime. j'ai fait de la socio-sémio alors que j'ai je suis pas quelqu'un de doué pour ça j'ai j'ai j'ai toujours fait ce pour quoi je ne suis pas douée et là tout naturellement j'invite des gens à à . et toi en l'occurrence et d'autres à à et puis je me suis rendue compte que le nom de la rue où je suis née est magnifique. Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie et la Bretonnerie c'est le lieu des Bretons.. moi moi tu vois moi euh née cyanosée euh euh comme dit ma mère\", \"c'est quoi cyanosée\", \"ben je je tu sais ce que c'est les les enfants nées nées cyanosées c'est des enfants qui naissent étouffés parce que le l'accouchement c'est très mal passé.. et: y a deux solutions où: en général le cerveau est atteint et ça fait des petits manteaux à 80 pour cent et alors ils ont de toute façon des des lésions pas mal. et moi j'en ai quelques unes hein je peux pas faire la galipette (01:04:00) tu vois je peux pas j'ai des: j'ai des petits trucs comme ça: bon mais: euh moi née cyanosée c'est comme dit ma mère quand tu est née tu étais morte toi tu vois euh bon euh c'est-à-dire que: je je je suis en train peut-être de me donner des lettres de noblesse quoi hein euh mais ça se fait d'une façon totalement euh pacifique sans outrance je crois sans: ... bon puis on règle tu sais je règle aucun compte en faisant ça . parce que les ça a rien à voir quoi.. et en même temps c'est c'est bien c'est bien et c'est vrai que: que je me suis rendue compte que j'étais née Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie en aimant un Breton.. et et je lui je n'arrêtais pas de lui dire . t` as vu où je suis née t` as xxx mais comme lui ne répondait pas à cet appel amoureux oh ben je vois pas je vois pas tu vois quel indice terrible (rires) .. et d'ailleurs il habite au Nord au Nord du Marais. dans un quartier qui maintenant est habité complètement habité par par les Algériens et les Arabes.. (voix très basse) et puis le Marais c'est aussi: y a une chose dont je n'ai pas parlé c'est aussi quelqu'un qui s'appelle JACOB que j'allais voir qui qui était mécanicien sur machine à coudre. donc c'est tu sais c'est des gens qui faisaient du des prêt-à-porter quoi des: et qui habitait dans dans ce quartier là aussi. et que j'allais voir et que j'aimais beaucoup qui était membre du parti communiste euh qui était père de deux petites filles adorables (01:06:00) . et qui aimait Beethoven qui était: très illettré tu vois qui était qui ai- qui aimait Beethoven qui était communiste qui était très beau que j'adorais et: pendant la guerre: sa femme un jour il est parti quand il est revenu sa femme et ses deux petites filles avaient été déportées enfin emmenées aux camps et déportées et cet homme a. a gardé le lit de soie rosele petit lit tout tout le temps eh et quand j'allais le voir après-guerre en 50 en 55 le petit lit était propre il le lavait tout les semaines. prêt et j'ai connu cet homme qui après-guerre a recommencé à faire de du du prêt-à-porter à recommencé à être mécanicien sur machine à coudre dans le même petit appartement DÉGUEULASSE parce que les appartements étaient minuscules tu vois ils divisaient les: les les imm- les immenses les magnifiques lieux du Ma- qui avaient été le Marais en petits appartements immondes et puis des trucs construits tu vois et j'allais le voir là et de temps en temps il me donnait un pull ou un truc comme ça et on discutait politique énormément les deux. c'est un homme que j'aimait beaucoup et puis il avait la syphilis et il avait chopé ça parce qu'il aimait beaucoup les femmes (rire). et il est mort euh je faisais mes études de pharmacie donc en . 1960 par là tu vois. 58 par là il est mort et j'allais le voir très régulièrement dans le Marais justement là où on a tout détruit pour construire le centre Pompidou... tu vois dans ce quartier-là. donc c'était quand-même un quartier euh. euh alors cet homme je l'estimais beaucoup (01:08:00) tu vois\", \"et lui tu retournais le voir c'était pas:\", \"et lui je retournais le voir et je retournais le voir pour parler avec lui pour pour l'écouter il me donnait des pulls c'était: lui il me faisait échapper à la honte parce qu'il avait l'âge de mes parents et c'était quand même un homme ouvert sur le monde et beaucoup plus cultivé que mes vieux tu vois il savait lire il savait écrire . il était communiste tu vois c'était autre chose et alors en plus ce cet homme était euh. bon alors en plus FANNY ma petite copine me disait beaucoup de mal de lui parce qu'il non seulement il aimait les femmes mais il aimait aussi les petites filles mais bon moi avec moi il a toujours été impeccable.. et je pense qu'il était amoureux de ma mère complètement amoureux de ma mère. mais qu'il s'est jamais rien passé tu vois c'était le grand ami de de mes parents. alors c'est très drôle parce que ces gens-là se sont retrouvés dans le quartier du Marais . euh lui euh: les parents là les cousins à la mode de Bretagne les parents de FANNY dans ce ils vivaient dans ce quartier alors qu'en fait tu sais on les on leur donnait des cartes depuis: la la Pologne où on leur disait il y a avait des TAUX de réfu- d'immigrés et mes parents devaient aller au Portugal et en fait ils ont tout fait. et là ils auraient eu des papiers et tout ils ont tout fait pour s'arrêter en France parce que c'était le pays de la liberté.. donc: tu vois c'est presque par hasard ils auraient pas dû aller là\", \"enfin c'est pas le hasard si ils ont tout fait\", \"enfin ils ont tout fait pour mais: mes parents devaient aller au Portugal JACOB lui devait a- aller jusqu'aux Etats-U- jusqu'en Amérique au Chili ou je sais plus où tu vois ils avaient des (01:10:00) des trajets qui qui étaient pré- pré- pré-faits enfin je sais pas comment je sais pas comment ça se passait j'ai jamais compris c'était des circuits d'ouv- je me demande si c'était pas des circuits d'ouvr- de clandestins. où on les emmenait où on leur disait tu vas aller travailler dans telle usine à tel endroit et c'était des des circuits can- clandestins avec des peut-être des cartes de travail\", 'ou pas carte mais travail', \"ou travail promis et s- et et et dès qu'ils arrivaient dans un lieu qui leur plaisait plus ils s'arrêtaient avant en tout cas c'est ce qu'ils ont fait\", \"et le Marais c'était un peu la plaque-tournante\", \"ah c'était complètement la plaque-tournante c'était vraiment là où il trouvaient tout alors d'ailleurs mon père me raconte de Pologne on leur disait quand tu arrives quand tu arrives en France faut aller à la Bastille. faut absolument que tu ailles à la Bastille alors pourquoi la Bastille parce qu'à la Bastille y avait un flic qui parlait allemand et eux qui parlaient yiddish c'étaient les seuls avec qui ils pouvaient parler et alors ils disaient mais comment je saurai pour aller à la Bastille alors ils savaient de Pologne qu'il fallait faire ÇA tu vois tu feras comme ça c'est-à-dire une jambe levée et là je le dis pour: une une jambe levée un pied levé comme le génie de la Bastille donc ils s- connaissaient ce geste tout le monde se marrait tout le monde savait ce que ça voulait dire on leur disait où c'était et quand ils arrivaient à la Bastille y avait le flic allemand qui était là et y avait la QUEUE de tous les immigrés qui lui demandaient où allai- où aller et en fait c'était tout près du Marais. donc soit ils avaient des adresses soit ils avaient toujours une adresse d'un cousin d'un machin et mon père m'a raconté que eux quand ils sont arrivés ils ont été chez un bonhomme et le type a dit mais moi j'ai pas de place hein je peux pas vous recevoir et ils sont restés qu'un ou deux jours et ça été affreux parce que ils savaient pas où (01:12:00) aller dormir hein on leur disait bon d'accord tu dors ce soir par terre parce qu'on peut pas te foutre dehors mais demain tu t` en vas et puis ils avaient tu vois ils avaient des petits bouts d'adresses comme tu vois les arabes là euh avec avec une adresse écrite dégueulasse depuis les les fins fonds de la Pologne pour arriver là (toux) et leur angoisse c'était de trouver du boulot dans des ateliers clandestins et TOUT le Marais était enfin ce qu'on appelle maintenant le Marais tout ce quartier-là était bourré d'ateliers clandestins où les les bons français venaient s'alimenter chercher de la main-d’oeuvre bon marché donc c'était véritablement une plaque-tournante donc c'était pas que le plätzel tu vois donc c'était ça avait une fonction multiple d'être un lieu comme je te l'ai dit dans mon schéma un lieu d'identité hein comme je disais fusionnelle où où où tu d'identifies à un bout de terre qui ressemble complètement à ce que tu es c'est en même temps une plaque-tournante de main-d’oeuvre et c'était donc un véritable CENTRE un véritable centre de de la main-d’oeuvre et de et là où tu te reposes pour pouvoir repartir là c'était en même temps troisième chose un ghetto où tu es dans le refuge dans le sens où Wirth a décrit le ghetto tu connais ce bouquin de Wirth hein où tu es en attente de de de pouvoir te recycler après la preuve c'est qu'ils sont restés un an et demi deux ans ou je sais plus combien mais très peu pour ensuite se retrouver en banlieue.. donc c'est et c'est très marrant le circuit de ma famille puisque que. on est arrivé dans le Marais disons deux trois ans après on est en banlieue rouge et pourrie et dégueulasse et misérable près de la ZONE de la place d'Italie et la zone de la place d'Italie il faut voir ce que c'était tu vois c'était un bidonville on appelait ça une zone (01:14:00) bon j'étais toute p- je vivais là moi hein avec tous tous les gens de la zone c'était des des cart- des maisons fabriquées avec en cartons et en taule ondulée comme les bidonville place d'Italie porte de Gentilly tout le périphérique c'était ça hien donc on était là et puis donc on vit dans un coin encore plus pourri que le que le centre de Paris tu vois et puis euh qu'est-ce qui se passe euh . je m'intègre encore plus en allant à la cité universitaire d'Antony et en m'éloignant encore plus de Paris.hein. euh j'ai pas d'intégration sociale je vais dans une cité universitaire je deviens étudiante et puis qu'est-ce que je fais je trouve du boulot euh à Paris et puis je me déplace de la cité jusqu'à Paris de la banlieue jusqu'à Paris puis summum d'intégration sociale je deviens prof et je vais donc en province et puis dernière étape de mon intégration sociale je retourne à Paris à Saint-Germain à Saint-Germain euh ou ou dans le 12e si tu veux mais en centre ville dans et et dans un tu vois c'est un périple spatial qui est un périple de l'ascension sociale et le jour où j'aurai un poste en fac j'aurai fait tout le circuit. un poste en fac à Paris.. bon et je crois que ce schéma il est totalement classique c'est un schéma de l'intégration. euh mon frère a fait de même mon frère lui a ét- est à Orléans alors il remontera même pas à Paris parce que parce que Orléans ça suffit comme intégration puis lui s'est marié avec une bourguignonne alors lui il s'est intégré encore plus parce qu'il s'est marié à une à une catholique enfin tu vois (01:16:00)  mais le circuit est fantastique avec entre temps un passage en Corrèze dans dans la la région la plus la plus sauvage de la Corrèze où y a où y avait même pas d'eau courante et toutes les femmes étaient gouâtreuses mais ça c'était dû à la guerre si tu veux et où on se met à parler patois et où je vis en sabots..\", 'ça a duré combien de temps ', \"quatre ans quatre cinq ans . la guerre (dit très bas presque un murmure) le Marais c'est c'est c'est un périple enfin c'est un ghetto d'intégration\", \"c'est intéressant ce que tu dis à la fois . un périple et à la fois c'est le c'est le un retour sur ce lieu ce lieu en fait qui s'est où tu es né xxx\", \"j'arrive pas à t'entendre\", \"oui c'est à la fois Paris qui est le lieu de cette mobilité sociale et intégration sociale en fait mais c'est ça se superpose et sur le même lieu tu dis xxx c'est-à-dire que le Marais bon tu ne l'appelles pas le Marais d'ailleurs tu l'appelle plätzel ou tu tu tu donnais les noms des rues tout à l'heure . et y a une autre chose que tu ajoutais en en parlant c'est cette .. j'sais pas je pense à ça à ce que tu disais maintenant je le je le valorise je suis là avec les gens qui l'ont valorisé et je le revalorise aussi dans mon travail tu le valorises et tu l'étudies en le valorisant et tu le rends aussi savant enfin et en même temps moi j'entendais ce que tu disais sur le moyen-âge tout à l'heure sur le la renomination et dans le fond (01:18:00) . et ce que tu disais à l'origine du du du nom d'avoir le nom d'une ville et: là tu dis pas des noms différents c'est plätzel c'est pas c'est c'est encore un nom d'ailleurs sur ce lieu et là tu tu tu l'appelles encore par d'autres noms voilà je dis ça parce que ce que tu appelles par d'autres noms c'est une autre façon de te situer dans le dans le dans ton habiter tu vois.\", \"non mais si tu veux c'est quand même le sens de toute la recherche le sens de la recherche c'est de

de de de forcément d'enracinement euh et: que l'espace cet espace du Marais a été REmodelé à chaque fois par le type de population qui l'habitait et que si tu veux l'esthétique du Plätzel c'est une esthétique c'est une esthétique ces gens vivaient là\", \"est-ce que c'était une es- est-ce que c'est pas le même sens de dire maintenant c'est une esthétique que ce que tu dis à l'époque c'était une

paires des semblables c'est un espace du centre et tout cela se superpose mais à (01:20:00) chaque étape de l'histoire de ce quartier l'espace est remodelé par la population et la population remodèle

souvent ou les gens illettrés sont plus fous que nous c'est qu'ils n'ont pas de matériel symbolique suffisamment fort pour suturer leurs névroses. tu vois et c'est pour ça que moi je dis toujours les les ouvriers sont très souvent enfin ceux qui ont des eu qui ont eu des tuiles si tu veux sont souvent extrêmement névrosés. et que les bourgeois souvent s- j'ai toujours remarqué ça qu'ils sont

odeur\", 'cette odeur tu la situes fortement à ce moment à ce repas', 'non non non ', 'non', 'non non ', 'non ', \"non c'est autant les le tonneau des yiguikes et des et des harengs dont je te parlais tout à l'heure quoi\", \"mais en même temps là tu l'as repris par rapport à ce mariage le lieu de ce mariage xxx qui est un rite de passage un univers symbolique en tout cas\", \"non je pense pas que je l'ai vécu comme ça ça c'était vraiment pour faire plaisir à mes parents\", 'oui mais que tu le veuille ou non xxx', \"oui et c'est vrai et ce et ce et c'est venu se revivre (01:34:00) là donc c'est venu se revivre là tu vois et par exemple ma mère me racon- allait très souvent aux BAINS au Plätzel tu vois parce qu'il y a y a un bain tu vois y a des bains collectifs au Plätzel et l'autre jour je suis passée devant et y avait marqué hammam alors ça pour moi c'est la déchéance et si tu veux le Plätzel a commencé à ne plus être le Plätzel pour moi avec l'arrivée des Séfarades parce que les Séfarades ont vi- ont vidé les Ashkénazes et ils ont commencé à introduire d'abord une une odeur de cuisine différente et du couscous et: et: bon et c'est quand même euh c'est quand même PLUS le le le Plätzel euh d'abord il est moins misérable euh les Séfarades avaient plus de fric euh euh . il est moins pris dans la tristesse de de parce que ce quartier faut voir que les ramassages de juifs etc qui ont eu lieu dedans enfin tu vois il est marqué par il marqué quand même imaginairement par la guerre par l'étoi- par l'étoile par par des gens qui travaillaient dans des métiers tout à fait PARTICULIERS que pour moi les Séfarades c'est des gens qui n'ont jamais souffert de l'antisémitisme et et si tu veux ce qui est clair pour moi c'est que les Séfarades n'ont pas souffert fondamentalement de l'antisémitisme les juifs de New York non plus et pour moi c'est pas des juifs les juifs euh y a les Israéliens les Juifs de New York euh j` sais pas quoi les Séfarades tout ça ne sont pas des juifs les juifs pour moi c'est c'est c'est les les juifs de ghetto les juifs qui ont peur des pogroms (voix basse sur tout le passage) c'est les gens qui ont l’oeil inquiet et qui vivent le le racisme c'est ça pour moi l'identité juive (01:36:00) et ce lieu-là est un espèce de de refuge MINUSCULE dans un dans une mer de danger voilà ce que c'est pour moi le Plätzel c'est c'est c'est c'est cette espèce de malheureux hublot dans dans un monde euh où on peut toujours te te te ramasser parce que tu portes l'étoile quoi. ce qui fait que l'arrivée des Séfarades ben ça devenait un quartier. euh un quartier TYPÉ hein euh spécialisé si tu veux bon comme un autre quoi\", \"mais c'est xxx qui colle sur une autre identité xxx ce qui est doublement \", 'voilà', \"si encore c'étaient des étrangers aux juifs [qui avaient\", '                                            [presque', \"mais LÀ c'est pire\", \"c'est pire \", \"c'est une [revendication de la même au nom des juifs\", \"          [ils venaient s'approprier un quartier qui était un quartier au nom des vrais juifs et ça c'est vrai si tu veux bon c'est terrible parce que les Séfarades souffrent terriblement du du mépris des juifs Aske- Ashkénazes en Israël euh et que moi je suis tout le temps étonnée parce que pour moi dis-donc un juif Séfarade dis-donc quelle PAIX quelle PAIX enfin on les a pas envoyés dans les dans les chambres à gaz tu comprends .. pour moi les juifs Séfarades c'est la c'est la MORGUE c'est c'est ne pas avoir pas peur de porter haut haut et clair sa religion sa croyance euh y a pas de HONTE chez ces gens là pour moi la jui- la juiverie c'est la honte tu vois c'est: bon et je fais quand même partie de ces gens qui ont été très souvent contre le sionisme parce que: ils ils craignaient la perte de l'identité juive comme (01:38:00) preuve sociale vivante euh de l'existence d'un peuple entier qui SUPPORTE le le qui supporte la la haine humaine et si tu veux ce que j'ai compris en analyse c'est que pour moi les juifs c'est c'est le Christ c'est les VRAIS Christs si tu veux c'est EUX les gens qu'on crucifie\", 'xxx rédemption', \"c'est eux toujours la la NON parce que pour moi on les crucifie parce qu'ils prennent toute la haine du monde sur eux c'est des martyres si tu veux y a un peu de ça chez moi y a un peu euh une identité du martyrologe et on est des gens intelligents on va te faire payer tout le temps et on nous le fait payer tout le temps et on est intelligent parce qu'on est des gens à qui on le fait payer on fait payer euh à qui on fait payer le le la haine du monde est sur nous et du coup on a que ça comme défense enfin si tu veux tout ça est complètement lié moi les Séf- le les Séfarades je peux jamais les définir comme des jui- des intellectuels y a des intellectuels chez les Séfarades mais si tu veux c'est c'est pas reconnu comme un PEUPLE entier pris dans l'intelligence tandis que moi j'ai un père qui sait ni lire ni écrire et et dont je suis persuadée que c'est un des êtres les plus intelligents que j'ai euh connus donc c'est pas lié à la culture si tu veux tu vois c'est euh quand on a souffert comme ça on ne peut pas ne pas être intelligent c'est pas possible on est obligés tellement de penser à la façon dont les AUTRES vont vous appréhender vous regarder vous donc on est des si tu veux bon je dirais presque des sociologues nés quand on est des gens comme ça.. pour moi la sociologie est juive c'est Durkheim c'est pas Touraine tu vois c'est c'est Lévi-Strauss et et (01:40:00) c'est et c'est pas Bourdieu bon je sais pas comment te dire c'est pour moi c'est pareil euh Bourdieu Touraine pour moi ça peut être de grands sociologues mais mais si tu veux . quoi connaître les autres ça leur tient pas aux tripes comme comme comme pour nous c'est c'est VITAL c'est vital de comprendre le moindre signe de tu tu comprends.. j` sais pas: on est sociologue comme on respire faut entendre faut entendre même ma mère analyser alors que c'est une femme très fruste tu vois analyser l'autre mais quelle intelligence dans l'aigreur hein il faut bien le reconnaître mais voilà (tout ce passage avec voix très basse et grave) c'était quand même un quartier comme ça c'était quand même un quartier euh ... bon il est plus il est plus il est dev- il est devenu exotique quoi alors on te vend du tarama mais enfin c'est incroyable vendre du tarama à côté de la à côté du gefilte fisch enfin c'est insensé c'est deux mondes .. et alors on l'associe par racisme parce que c'est les deux: ou par ou par identité religieuse par identité religieuse mais c'est pas les mêmes tu vois comment ça fonctionne enfin je parle pas d'objectivité là hein (rire dans la voix) je parle de ma façon de de réagir à ça tu vois et puis voilà cette idée que que ce quartier qui était pour moi un quartier pourri en fait a comme socle un marais un marécage de la flotte de la pourriture (01:42:00) sur lequel on conçoit un quartier royal et où Mlle de Scudéry euh trône si tu veux (voix rieuse) tu vois c'est un peu ça bon c'est tellement paradoxal c'est tellement étrange c'est tellement c'est pour ça que c'est merveilleux de travailler sur ce quartier \", \"c'est comme si dans le fond le point de lecture de de la culture historique du MARAIS justement dans ce que tu dis dans ce mot justement ça commence à être intelligent à partir de de xxx c'est pas seulement une culture qui donne un autre droit de culture c'est une culture qui donne une lecture à mon avis qui peut donner une coupe\", \"oui peut-être oui c'est: . si tu veux c'est quand même bon de ce que je connais euh le seul quartier qui ait vu se superposer des choses aussi étrangères les unes aux autres euh aussi radicalement et alors en récurant le Marais comme on le fait maintenant qu'est-ce qu'on fait euh on EXOTISE un un peuple et et et on fait ressurgir une histoire du passé et pour moi bon tout le postmoderne c'est ça \", 'qui occulte ce qui se fait encore', \"qui N'OCCULTE rien non \", 'tu penses pas', 'non', \"qu'il continue [que l'étranger continue à vivre là\", \"               [non c'est tout le contraire le postmoderne le le postmoderne n'est pas une occultation non moi j'ai j'ai une définition du postmoderne qui est qui est totalement sociologique et je dis que malgré ces aberrations sa connerie tout ce que tu veux. c'est: une société entière qui s'interroge sur ses origines de façon la plus naïve qui soit de façon tout ce que tu veux mais pour moi c'est de la réflexivité c'est du clin d’oeil (01:44:00) hein mais c'est de la réflexivité et là bon je je t'ai pas donné encore ce ce truc que j'ai écrit là-dessus bon je crois je crois que j'ai raison profondément je retrouve nulle part à à ce point exprimé ce que j'ai dit là parce que j'ai écrit trop peu si tu veux là-dessus mais non ça n'occulte au contraire au contraire c'est c'est un travail de redécouverte mais effectivement de redécouverte qui va qui ne peut être qu’amusée étrangère trahissante parce que parce que parce que parce que parce qu'elle sur-souligne parce qu'elle remarque parce que si tu REMARQUES quelque chose euh regarde ce que mot REMARQUER veut dire il veut dire marquer à nouveau ça n'occulte pas c'est beaucoup plus complexe les discours sur l'occultation j'ai horreur de tous ces discours-là sur l'enracinement l'occultation les machins euh c'est c’est TELLEMENT plus compliqué qu` ça c'est tellement plus compliqué qu` ça un souvenir par exemple il n'occulte pas le passé il le il le il le transverse tu vois il le transverse faut faut une intelligence beaucoup plus grande tu vois que ces ces mots là sont c'est c'est comme le mot d'enracinement c'est des mots TRAÎTRES à l'extrême c'est des mots qui enlèvent l'intelligence de ce qui se passe . est-ce que la Renaissance quand elle a redécouvert tout l'art grec et romain est-ce qu'elle a occulté pourtant dieu sait quelles trahisons elle a pu opérer est-ce que euh euh comment il s'appelle Viollet-le-Duc occulte le Moyen-Age à la fois il le trahit totalement il dit que des conneries sur par exemple euh le fonctionnalisme du gothique et puis à la fois mon vieux mais c'est grâce à lui que que que le gothique aussi a été redécouvert (01:46:00) c'est c'est si tu veux la la perversité sociale elle est elle fonctionne comme ça et c'est c'est très bien euh moi j'adore euh Viollet bon il a fait des conneries mais mais il a sauvé tu comprends c'est tellement plus complexe les choses et le postmoderne j'ai pas du tout envie de l'enterrer moi j'aime y a des choses qui sont dans le postmoderne complètement connes et puis d'autres qui sont qui vont êtres merveilleuses euh tu tu vois bon Bofill c'est de la paranoïa mais y en a d'autres qui font des choses merveilleuses même chez Bofill y a des choses belles et des choses ratées tu vois . on est des sociologues on n’a pas à avoir des jugements moraux c'est c'est on a à voir comment ça fonctionne et puis c'est tout. alors je veux pas je j- j'ai pas du tout envie de d'enterrer le postmodernisme comme font beaucoup de gens pas du tout y en aura un mauvais y en aura un bon un créateur et d'autres qui ne le re- qui ne le sera pas tu sais moi je suis tu sais quand quand quand euh Lévi-Strauss décrit le fonctionnement des des sociétés traditionnelles sous le modèle du bricolage hein bon ben pour moi c'est très important on ne crée c'est ça la création c'est de la brico- on bricole on revient sur le passé et on le rebricole autrement et puis voilà le problème c'est ce de savoir ce qu'on en fait mais ça c'est autre chose .. et je trouve notre époque qui refuse la l'idéologie extrêmement intéressante si tu veux c'est une époque de grande modestie de grande modestie enfin où sont nos (inaudible) mais malheureusement malheureusement ça risque d'être récupéré dans dans dans dans une société qui est une société (01:48:00) marchande ma foi ça pour moi je suis bon fondamentalement anti-capitaliste alors c'est vrai que là je je tourne en rond comme une contradiction je je \", '(inaudible: sur la société marchande)', \"bon alors c'est très emmerdant pour moi j'ai une telle haine de la rentabilité que ça m'emmerde ... et c'est ma contradiction si tu veux .\", \"d'autant plus une contradiction que que ce capitalisme là est commun à xxx soit lié aux processus de la société\", 'j` sais pas c\\'est comme le mot \"quelque part\" dont j\\'ai horreur que j\\'ai horreur de ce mot parce que à chaque fois qu\\'on dit quelque part je dis ouf (rire) parce que c\\'est un une façon de dire de de localiser sans lieu ça c\\'est un terme très dangereux les copules répétées sont toujours des choses dangereuses parce que ça permet de de dire tout en ne disant pas ', 'non mais je ', 'tu vois par exemple l\\'autre jour en taxi le type qui était si savant et qui parlait me disait tout le temps \"si vous voulez\" et évidemment il a parlé tout le temps et il ne m\\'a jamais vue et il m\\'a noyée de paroles et et de contours puisque j\\'en j\\'ai (rire) il m\\'a fait traverser tout Paris trois fois pour pouvoir parler euh et ce \"si vous voulez\" voulait dire exactement vous ne voudrez pas c\\'est moi qui parle vous ne voulez pas et je ne vous laisserai pas et il disait sans arrêt \"si vous voulez\" mais non je ne voulais rien . tu vois \"si vous voulez\" ben il aurait dû me dire qu\\'est-ce que vous voulez et j\\'ai pas eu le droit de vouloir moi j\\'ai j\\'ai très très peur de ces mots (01:50:00)', 'xxx', \"ça c'est c'est comme le mot besoin qu'on a sorti à toutes les sauces et qui évidemment le bout du mot besoin c'est que effectivement ce n'est plus un besoin parce qu'un besoin c'est vital\", 'l\\'emploi du mot \"quelque part\" est lié pour moi parce que je ne sais pas où le qualifier simplement et en même temps je suis gêné qu\\'on parle du bricolage pour dire au fond de quelle marchandise on transfère en même temps c\\'est-à-dire xxx c\\'est pas le droit de l\\'économie marchande en termes de structure mais parce que la

Qu’est-ce qu’il y avait avant le Big Bang? Est-ce qu’il y aura une fin du monde? Ça va se passer comment? Et puis: Y a-t-il d’autres planètes habitées? Crois-tu aux extraterrestres? Mes amis me disent aussi que dans tes livres tu fais beaucoup de comparaisons culinaires. Ils me parlent du potage aux lettres et du pudding aux raisins que ta mère préparait. : Nous allons parler de tout cela. Grâce aux sciences, et en particulier à l’astronomie, nous comprenons maintenant beaucoup de choses. Mais il y a des quantités de questions qui restent sans réponses. Beaucoup d’énigmes non résolues. Je vais t’en faire part pour que tu n’aies pas l’impression que nous savons tout. Notre Univers reste encore profondément mystérieux… Étends-toi bien sur ton transat et ferme les yeux. Respire profondément. Porte ton attention sur toutes les parties de ton corps: tes pieds, tes mains, tes doigts… Tes yeux, tes oreilles, ton nez. Tu y es? : Oui, je sens tout mon corps. : Pour chacun d’entre nous, l’Univers commence par ça: ce que tu sens, ce qui te permet de voir, d’écouter, de percevoir à la fois ton monde intérieur et le monde extérieur. Tu fais partie de l’Univers et c’est par ton corps et ton esprit que nous allons l’explorer. Ouvre les yeux maintenant. C’est la nuit, le ciel est clair. Il y a des étoiles partout, des brillantes et d’autres très faibles, à peine visibles à l’œil nu. Il y a la Terre qui nous porte, le Soleil qui nous éclaire le jour et la pâle Lune. L’Univers c’est tout cela. Tout, tout, tout. Mais pour commencer, dis-moi, quel âge as-tu? : J’aurai bientôt quatorze ans. : Où étais-tu il y a vingt ans? : Mais je n’existais pas, grand-papa. : Bien sûr! Moi j’existais, pas toi. Puis il y a eu un évènement extraordinaire, tu es née, tu es venue au monde, tu as commencé à exister. Tu es entrée dans l’Univers. Avant, tu n’y étais pas.  Je ne parle pas du jour de ta naissance qui est maintenant la date de ton anniversaire. Je parle du moment, environ neuf mois auparavant, où ton père et ta mère t’ont conçue en faisant l’amour. Ce jour est pour toi bien plus important que celui de ton anniversaire. Ce jour-là, tu es apparue sur une petite planète, la Terre, qui tourne autour du Soleil, qui lui-même tourne autour du centre de notre Galaxie, la Voie lactée, une des innombrables galaxies de notre Univers. Cela s’est passé dans le ventre de ta mère. Des millions de petites cellules avec une longue queue (les spermatozoïdes) ont été injectées par ton père. Les voilà engagées dans une course de vitesse. Elles se dirigent précipitamment vers l’ovule qui attend et qui sera l’autre moitié de toi. Quelle ardeur dans la compétition! De tous ces prétendants, un seul nous importe ici, celui qui gagnera la course. Il va pénétrer dans l’ovule et le fertiliser. Les autres vont mourir. Et toi, tu viens d’entrer dans l’existence grâce à ces deux cellules qui, en s’unissant, sont devenues toi. Tu es maintenant une habitante du cosmos. C’est à ce moment que tu commences à vivre la longue aventure de ta vie. Pendant les neuf mois qui suivent, le petit ovule fertilisé devient un embryon, puis, ensuite, un fœtus. Les cellules de ton corps se mettent en place pour te permettre de vivre et de connaître le monde dans lequel tu es entrée le jour de ta naissance, quand tu es sortie du ventre de ta mère. Plus tard, tu as ouvert les yeux, tu as regardé le monde, et tu t’es préparée à me poser des questions comme celle-ci: «Grandpapa, c’est quoi l’Univers?» Mais déjà, je vais te donner une information étonnante : s’il n’y avait pas eu, bien avant ta naissance, des étoiles dans le ciel, tu n’existerais pas, tu ne serais pas née. Ni moi, d’ailleurs… Et nous ne serions pas ici en train de parler. : Je ne peux pas imaginer que les étoiles si lointaines dans le ciel ont quelque chose à voir avec mon existence. C’est merveilleux ! Comment peux-tu savoir ça ? : Nous allons y venir. Mais avant, je vais t’expliquer beaucoup de choses. : Je ne regarderai plus jamais les étoiles de la même façon. Mais je n’arrive pas à savoir si elles sont proches ou lointaines. Explique-moi, comment peut-on connaître, par exemple, la distance entre la Terre et le Soleil? : Nous allons commencer par nous intéresser à notre Soleil. Ce soir, nous allons à notre observatoire pour le voir se coucher. Cette grosse boule lumineuse qui descend lentement vers l’horizon, c’est une étoile comme celles que nous voyons la nuit. Mais les autres étoiles sont si loin qu’elles nous paraissent bien peu lumineuses en comparaison. Parmi toutes les étoiles du ciel, nous avons la chance d’en avoir une tout près de nous! : Oui, mais à quelle distance? : Évidemment, il est plus loin que les montagnes derrière lesquelles il va se coucher. : Beaucoup plus loin ? : Les hommes se sont posé cette question pendant très longtemps avant de trouver la réponse. Certains disaient qu’il était très loin, d’autres qu’il était tout près. On raconte qu’un prisonnier, nommé Icare, et son père avaient projeté de s’enfuir en s’élevant dans le ciel grâce à deux ailes fixées dans le dos avec de la cire. Mais Icare commit une imprudence fatale en s’approchant du Soleil: la cire fondit et il se noya dans l’océan. : Alors comment peut-on mesurer ces distances? : Il y a plusieurs méthodes. En voici une qui sert par exemple pour la Lune et le Système solaire. Rappelle-toi nos promenades dans les montagnes, l’été dernier. Nous nous amusions à crier pour écouter l’écho de nos voix. Selon la distance, il nous revenait après un temps plus ou moins long. Le son (notre cri) voyage vite : trois cents mètres par seconde. Si l’écho parvient après deux secondes (: une : deux), tu sais que la falaise est à trois cents mètres (une seconde pour l’aller, une seconde pour le retour). Pour mesurer les distances dans le Système solaire, on utilise la même méthode, pas avec le son comme pour l’écho en montagne, mais avec la lumière. : Il y a des échos de lumière? : Oui, comme il y a des échos de son. Mais bien plus rapides: la lumière va mille fois plus vite  que le son. Aujourd’hui, pour mesurer la distance de la Lune, on envoie un rayon radar (une sorte de lumière) vers sa surface. L’écho revient de la Lune en deux secondes (une pour aller, une pour revenir). La Lune est à une seconde-lumière. Pour aller au Soleil, la lumière met huit minutes. On dit que le Soleil est à huit minutes-lumière. Il y a quelquefois de gros orages qui éclatent à la surface du Soleil. Des éclairs embrasent sa surface. Mais on ne les voit que huit minutes plus tard. Quand nous les observons sur la Terre, nous savons qu’ils ont eu lieu huit minutes plus tôt. Pourquoi? Parce que la lumière de ces éclairs a dû parcourir la distance entre le Soleil et nous. : Cela veut dire que le Soleil que nous observons ce soir est le Soleil tel qu’il était il y a huit minutes? Comment est-il maintenant? A-t-il changé en huit minutes? : Pour le savoir, il nous faut attendre… huit minutes. En fait, nous sommes juste à bonne distance de notre étoile. Plus loin, il ferait très froid et nous ne pourrions pas vivre. Plus près, il ferait trop chaud et l’eau de l’océan s’évaporerait. Sans eau liquide, il n’y aurait pas de vie non plus. C’est parce que notre Terre est à une bonne distance du Soleil que la vie a pu s’y développer et que nous y vivons confortablement. Attendons maintenant la nuit. Le Soleil est  couché. Les étoiles apparaissent dans le ciel. Leur lumière a voyagé longtemps avant de nous arriver sur la Terre. Certaines des étoiles que nous voyons sont situées à des dizaines, des centaines, et même à des milliers d’années-lumière. Par exemple, l’étoile Polaire, celle qui nous indique le Nord, est à quatre ent trente années-lumière.

Vous espérez ou redoutez dêtre enceinte ? Voici quelques éléments dinformations pour y voir clair, enrichis pas les conseils des forumeurs/forumeuses. Mais ce nest pas sur un forum qui réunit des gens ordinaires comme vous que vous pourrez obtenir toutes les réponses : : voyez plutôt un médecin généraliste, un gynécologue, une infirmière scolaire ou un centre de planning familial. Détails et adresses de ces derniers sur www.planning-familial.org   Vous trouvez également dans cette fiche quelques informations sur la contraception, mais lidéal est de consulter un site officiel (donc contrôlé) comme www.contraceptions.org ou dinterroger un des professionnels cité plus haut. Si vous redoutez une grossesse, sachez quil suffit dune seule relation sexuelle ¿ même très brève ¿ pour quelle survienne, donc la contraception est importante et la responsabilité doit être partagée par les deux (ou plus) partenaires. Le recours à lavortement est à envisager en dernier recours et non comme un contraceptif, car cest un acte douloureux psychologiquement.    Rappel sur le cycle féminin  Le cycle menstruel commence à la puberté et se termine à la ménopause quand il ny a plus de follicules. On dit quil dure 28 jours, mais en réalité la durée est variable dune femme à lautre, jusquà plus de 31 jours parfois. Cest pourquoi le moment où la femme est fécondable varie lui aussi.  Les phénomènes physiologiques du cycle amenant une possible fécondation sont contrôlés par des hormones. Cest pourquoi celles contenues dans les contraceptifs hormonaux empêchent le bon déroulement de chaque processus. Par ailleurs, les règles qui arrivent sous pilule contraceptive nont rien à voir avec les règles du cycle : il sagit dune hémorragie de privation, parce quil y a chute brutale du taux hormonal.  Pour simplifier, les ovaires contiennent des follicules. Seul lun deux (follicule de Graaf) parviendra à maturation, jusquà produire un ovocyte, les autres dégénèreront. La période dovulation, où la femme est fertile, est celle de la fin de la maturation de ce follicule, après quoi, son apparence se modifie, il se transforme en corps jaune (le nom vient dun pigment légèrement jaune, la lutéine, qui colore le corps jaune ; à cause de la lutéine, la phase de transformation de lovocyte à ce moment est appelée cycle lutéal). Les cellules folliculaires sécrètent des hormones pour continuer le processus. Lovule ainsi libéré glisse dans les trompes où peut se produire la rencontre avec un spermatozoïde. Lovule fécondé est appelé ¿uf ou zygote.  Les règles (menstruation) proviennent de la détérioration de la dentelle utérine ou endomètre, qui tapisse lutérus pour constituer une sorte de nid pour l¿uf et le futur embryon. Cest un peu comme si à chaque cycle il se détériorait seul pour laisser place à un endomètre tout neuf.  Les cellules du col de lutérus sécrètent une glaire, qui permet aux spermatozoïdes de progresser jusquà lovule. Elle est bien sûr peu abondante en début de cycle et abondante au moment de la phase ovulatoire. Celle-ci dure environ 24 heures, mais comme les spermatozoïdes vivent un certain temps, la période de fécondité est plutôt de 3-4 jours autour de lovulation. On parle de pic ovulatoire car elle se manifeste par laugmentation de la température (montée sur une courbe de température).  Ceci est très très simplifié, pour se remémorer les grands principes du cycle féminin. Il faut surtout retenir que le processus complet est soumis aux taux des différentes hormones et varie dune femme à lautre. Le cycle est régulier si les taux sont réguliers, si ce nest pas le cas, la pilule est un moyen de régulation et si vous souhaitez un enfant, vous devrez voir avec un gynécologue comment remettre les choses dans lordre. Il faut repérer le début de cycle avant le déclenchement des règles, la durée du cycle avec larrivée des suivantes et pour déterminer la phase ovulatoire, observer quelques signes somatiques (température, aspect de la glaire cervicale¿) ou utiliser un test dovulation vendu en pharmacie. Cest la connaissance de son cycle qui permet la contraception, puis si vous voulez un enfant, la conception.  Symptômes de la grossesse  Une femme enceinte peut (mais ce nest pas systématique !) avoir les seins qui gonflent, avec les tétons qui durcissent et sont légèrement douloureux, ressentir des nausées, une grande fatigue.  Mais ces symptômes peuvent être des indicateurs trompeurs, car ils sont liés à votre état de santé et/ou aux hormones, celles-ci peuvent avoir un taux inhabituel pour plein de raisons. Ressentir ces symptômes nest donc absolument pas significatif dune grossesse, seul un test sanguin (prescrit par le médecin) pourra valider celle-ci. De la même façon, labsence de règles, ou aménorrhée, nest pas un signe de grossesse, mais avant tout de dérèglement hormonal.  Le test de grossesse urinaire vendu en pharmacie (entre 11 et 15 euros non remboursés) est utilisable environ 3 jours après le retour présumé des règles, à tout moment de la journée (à condition de ne pas boire trop deau), mais la première urine du matin est plus concentrée. La plupart des tests sont fiables à 99%. Sil est positif, vous devrez tout de même effectuer un test sanguin pour le vérifier. Sil est négatif, il est possible, même si cest peu probable, que vous soyez quand même enceinte. Il est inutile de refaire un autre test le même jour ; attendez quelques jours. Le test peut être négatif bien que vous soyez enceinte si vous avez une infection urinaire, si vous faites une grossesse extra-utérine, si vous avez bu trop deau. Le test peut être positif bien que vous ne soyiez pas enceinte si vous avez recueilli votre urine dans un bocal nettoyé avec un détergent et plongé le test dedans (mieux vaut passer le bâtonnet directement sous le jet durine), si du sang se trouve dans lurine ou avec un traitement neuroleptique.  Seul le test sanguin est fiable à 100%. Il faut une prescription médicale.  En tout cas, inutile de stresser à lidée dune grossesse après un rapport sans un retard de règles, à moins davoir des cycles extrêmement irréguliers. Le meilleur moyen déviter ce stress cest dutiliser une contraception. :)  Rappel sur la contraception  Il nexiste pas de contraception préférable à une autre car chaque méthode ne convient pas forcément à toutes les femmes. Il est important de changer de contraception si celle qui a été choisie (cest vous qui choisissez) ne vous convient pas. Si vos relations sexuelles ne sont pas avec un partenaire stable (plusieurs mois de rapports et un test VIH), il convient de cumuler les moyens de contraception avec un préservatif, seule méthode de prévention des infections sexuellement transmissibles (Sida, hépatite B ou C, herpès génital, papillomavirus, syphillis, chlamydiae, etc).La contraception physique   ¿ Préservatif féminin : dune apparence assez proche du préservatif masculin, il se place dans le vagin avant un rapport de la même façon quun tampon hygiénique. Il est compatible avec nimporte quel lubrifiant, ne contient pas de latex (pas de risque dallergie). é usage unique, il peut se placer plusieurs heures avant le rapport, ce qui est très pratique. Il constitue une bonne alternative au préservatif masculin, en tant que contraceptif mais aussi en tant que prévention des infections sexuellement transmissibles (IST). Si votre partenaire refuse de mettre un préservatif, vous avez le droit de choisir de mettre un préservatif féminin, et si ça ne lui convient pas non plus, mieux vaut une abstinence ponctuelle, un effort de volonté, que dattraper une IST ou de tomber enceinte.  ¿ Dispositif intra-utérin (D.I.U.) ou stérilet : placé au fond de lutérus par un gynécologue, il se garde plusieurs années. Le cuivre empêche la rencontre des spermatozoïdes et de lovule. De petits fils dépassent pour permettre son retrait. Mais seul un médecin est apte à le placer ou le retirer. Il agit pendant 3 à 10 ans et nécessite un contrôle régulier (tous les ans). Il ne convient pas à toutes les femmes, mais est devenu accessible à beaucoup de femmes nayant jamais eu denfant.  ¿ Diaphragme et cape cervicale : le diaphragme recouvre le col de lutérus avant un rapport sexuel ; la cape cervicale est une cupule en silicone placée au fond du vagin pour recouvrir le col de lutérus afin dempêcher le sperme dentrer. Ils sont tous deux à usage unique. Il est conseillé dutiliser en même temps un spermicide. Il faut apprendre avec un médecin à placer lobjet. Cest lui qui évalue la taille nécessaire. Ils sont vendus en pharmacie ou au planning familial. Linconvénient cest que le placement est délicat et que lefficacité est faible si la cupule est mal placée. Par contre diaphragme et cape nont pas deffets secondaires, sont peu coûteux et peuvent être placés bien avant le rapport. Contraception chimique Les spermicides placés dans le vagin détruisent ou immobilisent les spermatozoïdes (vendus en pharmacie). Ils sont particulièrement conseillés pour une contraception pendant lallaitement, en cas doubli de pilule ou en renforcement du préservatif. Contraception naturelle Lobservation de son cycle et des glaires cervicales permet de savoir à quel moment du mois on ovule et donc déviter les rapports ou de se protéger ponctuellement durant les jours avoisinant cette date. Mieux vaut se protéger les premiers cycles au moins par un préservatif et du spermicide, le temps de repérer ces moments et dapprendre à évaluer la glaire. En tout cas, ces méthodes nont aucun des désagréments causés par les hormones.  ¿ La méthode Ogino est la plus répandue et pourtant la moins fiable : elle se base sur le calcul de la période fertile ; linconvénient cest que le déclenchement de lovulation peut légèrement varier.  ¿ La méthode des températures : la température corporelle reste constante pendant tout le cycle, sauf en période dovulation où elle augmente de quelques dixièmes de degrés. On reporte la température rectale prise le matin sur une grille et on prend en compte la montée de la courbe pour éviter les rapports. Une hausse ponctuelle de la température (fièvre) peut fausser le calcul. Cest pour cela quil est préférable de se fier à lobservation de plusieurs cycles pour avoir de bons repères.  ¿ La méthode Billings : elle repose sur lobservation de la glaire cervicale et elle est plus fiable. Les sécrétions vaginales changent en effet de consistance au moment de la période fertile : elles sont de plus en plus abondantes à lapproche de lovulation, avec une consistance ressemblant au blanc d¿uf (non cuit bien sûr). Labstinence commence au début de cette modification et jusquà 3 jours après. Il faut absolument se faire enseigner les moyens de repérage, cest trop délicat de ne se fier quà sa propre appréciation sans indications précises préalables. Contraception hormonale Elle diffuse des hormones (¿strogènes et/ou progestérone) qui bloquent lovulation ou réduisent la production de glaire cervicale, empêchant ainsi la progression des spermatozoïdes ou inhibant la muqueuse utérine pour que l¿uf ne puisse pas saccrocher. Elle nest disponible quen pharmacie, sur prescription médicale. Elle peut être fournie gratuitement aux mineures en centre de planning familial. Elle est contrindiquée aux femmes souffrant de problèmes hépatiques, de diabète non traité, dhypercholestérol, dhypertension, de phlébite, dembolie pulmonaire. Elle est fortement déconseillée aux fumeuses car elle accroît alors fortement les risques de maladies cardio-vasculaires.  ¿ Pilule contraceptive : cachets à prendre tous les jours pendant le cycle ou pendant 21 jours avec une interruption de sept jours avant une nouvelle plaquette, selon le type de pilule. Il faut être rigoureuse dans la prise de la pilule sans quoi la protection nexiste plus. Avec un retard de moins de 12 heures, il est possible den prendre deux en même temps pour rattraper, mais au-delà, mieux vaut une autre protection ou labstinence jusquà la prochaine plaquette. Le dosage diffère dun type de pilule à lautre, et comme il sagit dhormones il y a des effets secondaires, qui changent dune femme à lautre. Si les effets sont trop pénibles, vous devez songer à essayer une autre pilule : adressez-vous à votre médecin ou au planning familial. Certaines pilules sont particulièrement recommandées sil faut corriger un dérèglement hormonal, réduire lacné et/ou une pilosité excessive. Attention, toutes les pilules ne sont pas remboursées par la sécurité sociale, mais on peut réduire le coût en optant pour une version générique. En cas de vomissements dans les heures qui suivent labsorption, leffet contraceptif est fortement réduit et il est préférable denvisager un autre moyen.  ¿ Patch hormonal : cest un timbre qui se colle sur la peau (des fesses, du bas ventre, de la face extérieure du bras ou sur le haut du torse, mais pas sur les seins) le premier jour des règles et quon renouvelle toutes les semaines sauf les 7 derniers jours. Il nest pas remboursé par la sécurité sociale, mais lapplication hebdomadaire réduit un peu les risques doubli. Il a une efficacité comparable à celle de la pilule, mais avec moins deffet secondaire et sans perte deffet en cas de vomissement. Le patch résiste à leau et à la transpiration : sil est collé à un endroit sec, sans poils et sans trop de frottements de vêtements, il a peu de chances de se décoller.  ¿ Anneau vaginal : il se place à lintérieur du vagin le premier jour des règles et agit pendant 3 semaines avec une interruption de 7 jours en fin de cycle où il est remplacé. Les effets secondaires sont semblables à ceux de la pilule, mais les règles sont souvent moins longues, abondantes et douloureuses.  ¿ Implant : petit bâtonnet souple introduit sous la peau du bras par un gynécologue sous anesthésie locale. Il fait effet pendant 3 ans, mais peut être retiré avant. Il ne diffuse quun seul progestatif, généralement bien toléré par toutes les femmes, sans risque doubli. Il ne supprime pas les effets indésirables des hormones. Certaines femmes voient leurs règles fortement diminuer voire disparaître, dautres linverse.  ¿ Système intra-utérin hormonal (S.I.U.) : il est placé pour 5 ans comme un stérilet, mais il a un petit réservoir rempli dhormones diffusées pendant cette période. Stérilisation Une ligature des trompes peut empêcher le passage des ovules dans les trompes et donc une éventuelle conception, mais cest une méthode irréversible. La contraception masculine  La contraception nest pas nécessairement une affaire de femme. Lhomme peut utiliser un préservatif masculin lors du rapport, que ce soit lui qui le pose ou vous, sans que vous soyez sous contraceptif. Avant une toute première utilisation, il est préférable de sentrainer, sur un légume allongé, une petite bouteille ou autre, sans éprouver de honte, afin dêtre à laise avec le placement au moment opportun. Cela vaut toujours mieux quun préservatif crevé et ses conséquences.  Au passage, un préservatif cest solide et le sperme nest pas Musclor :) : si la capote se déchire cest quelle nest pas bien mise. Il vaut mieux sentraîner aussi à le retirer convenablement.  La pilule masculine est très peu utilisée, notamment parce quil faut attendre quelques mois pour quelle stoppe effectivement la spermatogenèse. Une pilule plus efficace est à létude. Lhomme peut recourir à la stérilisation (vasectomie), à savoir la section des canaux empruntés par les spermatozoïdes, mais lopération est irréversible. Certaines banques de sperme acceptent de conserver du sperme au préalable. La contraception durgence  Elle sutilise de manière ponctuelle après un rapport sexuel non protégé à nimporte quel moment du cycle.  ¿ Pilule à prendre dans les 12 heures (pilule du lendemain) au plus tard dans les 72h/3 jours (Norlévo, efficace à 80%) ou dans les 120 h/5 jours (pilule du surlendemain, ellaOne, efficace à 98,5%) suivant le rapport. La Norlévo est obtenue en pharmacie sans prescription médicale, gratuite pour les mineures. Elle peut être délivrée par les infirmières scolaires ou les centres de planning familial. Elle est remboursable à 65% par la sécurité sociale sur prescription médicale. LellaOne est uniquement délivrée sur prescription médicale. En cas de vomissement, il faut renouveler la prise.  ¿ DIU au cuivre, stérilet à faire poser au plus tard 5 jours après la date présumée de lovulation. Il est efficace à 99,99%.  à savoir : les infirmières scolaires peuvent délivrer la contraception durgence, dite pilule du lendemain, mais aussi accompagner les jeunes filles au planning familial pour la délivrance dun contraceptif (sans autorisation parentale) : il vaut mieux sadresser à elles avant un rapport sexuel que tenter la chance.  Elles sont autant tenues au secret professionnel quun médecin et ne diront rien aux parents.  Quand on parle dabstinence il sagit bien dabsence de pénétration, mais aussi de contact entre les parties génitales.  Il ne faut pas croire quun coït interrompu est une garantie (en plus ce nest pas des plus agréables pour les deux partenaires), car le pénis sécrète un liquide qui peut contenir un peu de spermatozoïdes. Idem pour les frottements du pénis sur la vulve. On ne meurt pas de labstinence.  Pour vaincre la frustration, il y a des caresses, de la tendresse, des massages, bien dautres moyens de calmer un peu ses ardeurs sans risque de grossesse. :)  Pour ne pas oublier la pilule, il faut trouver des moyens mnémotechniques. Par exemple, la plupart des téléphones portables ont des réveils ou alarmes que vous pouvez régler pour sonner tous les jours à la même heure.      _______________________  Vous pouvez signaler des erreurs et donner des conseils, cela sera corrigé ou intégré à la partie \"contributions des forumeurs\".

Ça marche mais il faut du temps.Fait aussi attention à ne pas avoir dobjet menaçant pour le chien comme un balais ou un bâton quand tu tapproche.Si les gourmandises cités plus haut nattirent pas le chien, il faut que tu utilise du roquefort avec de la mis de pain que tu aura mis en boule dans ta bouche (Vu le passer de ton chien je ne garanti pas le résultat car tu nest pas le premier maître, et, cest utiliser par les chasseurs pour faire lâcher prise aux chiens qui ramène le gibier).Pour les problème dalimentation, tu peux déjà commencer par donner à manger au chien en plusieurs fois ( Le matin, le midi, et le soir toujours après que tous les humains dans lhabitat ait mangés).Ensuite, tu peux essayer de donner à manger au chien dans une pièce ou il serait seul.Je ne garanti pas le résultat car à 6 ans, cest très dur de changer le comportement dun chien.Je te conseille également, si ce nest pas déjà fait, de prendre contact avec un club déducation canine ou dAgility, qui pourra peut-être te renseigner mieux que moi (sans voir le chien cest difficile de résoudre un problème de ce type).Modifié le 26 juin 2013 par Lko 30\\n', '@ JBlack:moi jai compris quelle avait peur (et pour cause), mais que ce nétait plus dactualité ? pour sa gamelle, jai pas trop compris ? si elle mange sa gamelle rapidement, cest plutôt bon signe, ou serait le problème daprès toi ?

La marche à suivre est assez longue :Dabord, quand le chien à peur, il ne faut pas le réconforter mais essayer de le faire jouer ( Pour un chien: jai peur + Caresses = Jai raison davoir peur) à noter que si le chien à vraiment très peur et que ce nest pas possible de le faire jouer, il faut quand même le câliner pour le rassurer et quil se calme.Ensuite, pour commencer la \"thérapie\" il faut prendre des ballons de baudruche, pour faire jouer le chien avec jusque à ce que le chien fasse éclater le ballon.Mais attention : il ne faut pas gonfler le ballon complètement au début, il faut commencer par un ballon très peu gonflé qui fera peu de bruit. Répéter cet exercice une à deux fois par jours (pas plus ) et selon la réaction du chien, augmenter progressivement le gonflage des ballons (donc le bruit de la crevaison ).Il faut savoir que, même avec ça, le chien ne sera pas totalement guéri, donc il réagira toujours aux explosions (feux dartifices, pétards ... ) mais il ne senfuira pas et naura pas de crise de panique.\\n', 'Bonjour,Petit post pour dire que je suis toujours ce sujet et que je suis toujours disponible pour répondre aux questions.Voilà, voilà. :)\\n', 'Nous allons cherché notre petite chienne dimanche matin.

Quand elle est détachée, elle restera plus facilement à côté mais avec la laisse, surtout au moment de sortir, elle tire vraiment beaucoup.

Perso, je trouve que pour un petit chien, un collier cest mieux. Par contre, pour les gros chiens qui ont tendance à tirer, ça soutient mieux je trouve et ça évite quil se fasse mal si le chien continue toujours de tirer. Jai un petit chien, au début elle tirait mais avec le temps, sans que je léduque à ce niveau, elle ne tire plus du tout. Mais là, cest juste mon avis perso. Et pour mon petit chien, même si elle tirait au début, javais pris un collier tout simple, cest pour les gros chiens, que des colliers spéciaux peuvent être mis.Modifié le 10 juillet 2013 par samira123\\n', 'Ton raisonnement et logique, mais, en fait cest l\\x92inverse, pour un petit chien, qui ne tire pas beaucoup (ça dépend quand même du chien y en a des petits qui tirent plus quun dogue allemand ) un harnais va très bien (un collier aussi dans le fond) mais pour les \"gros chien\" il vaut mieux éviter car ça leur donne beaucoup plus de puissance pour tirer sur la laisse, donc il sont plus difficile à retenir en cas de problème (crise de panique, un chat, un rat ...).Pour ce qui est du collier qui risque de faire mal au chien, ce nest pas le cas, en effet, les chiens ne sont pas mazo, si ça lui fait mal il n\\x92insiste pas.Par exemple mon père à un chien qui à un \\x9csophage qui est mal développé (il fait un siphon au niveau du cou) et un collier ne lui fait pas mal.Modifié le 10 juillet 2013 par Lko 30\\n', 'Pour ma chienne, jai trouvé quelle tirait moins avec le harnais, après pour les petits chiens, oui il y en a qui peuvent tirer beaucoup sur la laisse mais il na pas la force dun gros chien donc cest plus facile à arriver à sadapter, la petite tirait beaucoup au début mais cela nétait pas gênant alors quavec la grosse, il est arrivé quelle me fasse tomber. Et les colliers soient, certains se sont cassés où elle arrivait à lenlever, enfin pour ma part, je suis plus contente du harnais.

Si vous êtes jeune diplômé, définissez votre dernier diplôme obtenu, suivi de sa spécialisation et de lannée dobtention. Si vous avez vécu quelques années de chômage, mettez en valeur les démarches effectuées pour (re)trouver un emploi : bilan de compétences, cercle de recherche demploi, bénévole dans une association, etc. Dans léventualité où vous maîtrisez des langues, soulignez un séjour linguistique (le mieux est que celui-ci ait un minimum de durée de trois mois pour être pris en considération). Rubrique formation Pour les jeunes récemment diplômés, il est fortement conseillé de débuter votre parcours général par vos formations, dautant que vos expériences doivent être insignifiantes jusquici. Enumérez vos stages dans les entreprises, avec le type de mission confié par votre/vos responsable(s), précédée ou suivie par la durée. Pour les autres types de candidats, les formations sont à positionner après vos expériences professionnelles. Lordre de présentation, dans chaque cas de figure, est de la date la plus récente à la plus ancienne. A exclure : la mention des études primaires, voire secondaires, si vous avez obtenu des diplômes détudes supérieures. Allez à lessentiel ! Voici ce quil faut préciser pour chaque type de formations : le diplôme obtenu,la date dobtention,le nom de létablissement de formation ou universitaire et leur localisation,éventuellement : le programme de vos études (en une phrase courte).Rubrique expérience professionnelle Section la plus cruciale du CV, lexpérience professionnelle doit être égale au moins au deux-tiers du CV et ce, quel que soit le type de CV à adopter. Tout comme pour les formations, lordre de présentation idéal est de débuter par lemploi le plus récent et de remonter jusquau plus ancien. Par contre, cest superflu de faire lapologie de vos expériences en les énumérant toutes ! Vaut mieux limiter celles qui sont les plus significatives, particulièrement après une longue absence sur le marché du travail. Cette rubrique comporte tous les types dexpériences : stages, missions dintérim, jobs effectués parallèlement à vos études (sils sont récents) et même vos actions bénévoles dans une association car cela équivaut à une expérience mais non rémunérée. Ce dernier détail est malheureusement omis par les candidats ayant une activité dans le bénévolat. Avoir fait du soutien scolaire, par exemple, donne la preuve de votre maîtrise dans tel domaine de compétences. Lemployeur saura lire entre les lignes. Voici ce quil faut stipuler pour chaque type dexpériences : les dates dentrée et de sortie,le nom de lentreprise avec son secteur dactivité et éventuellement sa spécialisation,lintitulé du poste, suivi du service dans lequel vous avez travaillé,les missions qui vous ont été confiées avec les moyens matériels ou humains mis à votre disposition (en une ou deux phrases courtes),les résultats obtenus (comportant obligatoirement des chiffres !),le bilan positif de cette expérience (non obligatoire mais intéressant à signaler). Rubrique langues et informatiqueLangues Si vous êtes à laise dans une ou plusieurs langues étrangères, indiquez-le sous cette rubrique. Pour chacune des langues, spécifiez votre niveau et au mieux les séjours linguistiques effectués, soit dans le cadre de vos études, soit à titre personnel en guise de perfectionnement. Le fait de faire état de \"lu, écrit et parlé\", pour chaque langue, est insignifiant pour un employeur. Lexpérience linguistique en dit plus long sur votre vocabulaire réel que ces trois termes.Informatique Avec lère informatique, les connaissances liées à ce domaine sont devenues nécessaires, ne serait-ce pour ne pas se sentir dépassé. Ainsi, pour sortir du lot, il faut connaître la plupart des logiciels que les entreprises se servent au quotidien : word, excel, messagerie. Adaptez par conséquent vos compétences informatiques si et seulement si vous les maîtrisez dans votre domaine et que lemployeur les recherche. Sinon, passez outre !Rubrique divers/passions/centres dintérêt Ces rubriques annexes sont incontournables, telle la rubrique \"Sport\" si vous parvenez à faire apparaître votre sens de léquipe, ou \"Loisirs\" si vous pouvez préciser votre type de lecture ou de cinéma que vous aimez. Ces \"petits détails\" en disent très long sur votre personnalité et vos aptitudes naturelles.Votre âge est à indiquer en début de rubrique et non votre date de naissance. Accessoirement, à distinguer : votre situation de famille.Cette rubrique, loin dêtre un \"fourre-tout\", est surtout une manière de vous distinguer des autres candidats, en mettant laccent sur vos passions ou sur des compétences précises qui sont non assimilables lors dun cursus scolaire classique.Conclusion Le CV est très personnel.

De toute façon ils verront notre trombine avant de nous engager mais en ne mettant pas de photo, on risque de râter un entretien... Si le CV est top mais que la lettre de motivation ne suit pas, ce nest même pas la peine. Il est primordial de ne faire aucune faute dorthographe et de bien sexprimer. Les gens aujourdhui font des fautes et cela ne pardonne pas surtout si cest pour un emploi où il faut sexprimer par écrit comme cest souvent le cas aujourdhui avec les mails.Mieux vaut un CV sobre sans trop en faire avec une bonne lettre de motivation bien tournée quun CV se voulant sortir du lot qui perdra tout son attrait si la lettre est décevante.\\n', 'Trer bon sujet vraiment bravo sa aide beaucoup tu as de lexperience vraiment bravo sa ma beaucoup aider :\\n', 'Merci pour ce sujet si utile.

Pour la photo, cest vrai quelle est importante mais pensez bien à mettre une photo qui vous met en valeur et qui est pro. Si cest pour mettre une photo dans votre jardin ce nest pas la peine, de toute facon maintenant les RH regardent systématiquement sur internet : important de contrôler ses paramètres de confidentialité sur les réseaux sociaux. Pour finir je vous invite à lire cet article qui explique le temps que prennent les RH selon les pays pour regarder les CV : Article CV et recruteursCertains ne prennent que 1-3min donc cest vraiment important de tout miser sur laspect esthétique du cv pour les inciter à prendre plus de temps ensuite. Voilà pour mes conseils, jespère quils seront utiles à certains dentre vous ! Bonne journée\\n', 'Merci ! Jen aurai besoin :\\n', 'che pas\\n', 'il est très important au travaille alors il faut le faire bien\\n', 'Bon article, qui reprend plusieurs points que conseillent beaucoup de recruteurs. :) Un point sur lequel je ne suis pas tout à fait daccord en revanche : la forme.A moins de postuler pour un poste où \"avoir un joli CV\" peut faire une différence au premier coup doeil (par exemple, graphiste), il vaut mieux éviter les CVs trop exubérants.La plupart des CVs finiront imprimés en noir & blanc, il est donc important de penser à ce \"détail\" lorsquon fait un CV : un CV peut être joli en couleurs, et devenir moche en noir et blanc voire illisible sil ny a pas assez de contraste entre le fond et le texte.Deuxième point : dans certaines entreprises, les CVs peuvent passer par un tri informatique. Cest-à-dire que le CV sera numérisé, et quun logiciel recherchera certains mots clés dans le CV (lorsquil sagit dune réponse à une offre demploi notamment). Les CVs ne présentant pas ces mots-clés seront éliminé doffice sans parvenir jusquau bureau dun recruteur. Si les informations sont disséminées un peu partout et de manière farfelue, si le texte nest pas assez visible ou je ne sais quoi, un CV peut être éliminé même si les mots clés sont présents, car il ne passera pas létape informatique.Bref, il faut bien évidemment éviter le CV moche et condensé, mais il faut savoir rester sobre même si lon fait un CV \"moderne\". Les deux exemples mis sur cette page me paraissent donc être de mauvais exemples pour la plupart des personnes en recherche demploi.Et je conseillerais de jeter un oeil à ce que donne son CV en noir et blanc avant de lenvoyer quelque part, pour éviter toute mauvaise surprise. Je précise que je tiens ces informations des personnes assurant des cours sur les CVs, lettres de motivation & entretiens dembauche dans mon université. Parmi ces personnes, il y a un ancien DRH récemment retraité et dautre professionnels du recrutement. Je pense quil est par conséquent intéressant de prendre en compte ces éléments dans la mise en forme dun CV.\\n', 'A quand la modification du CV ?Style canadien.Ne pas le compresser, le faire sur 3 pages max.

Il est ainsi possible de diminuer son taux de cortisol (hormone-marqueur du niveau de stress excessif) et donc son stress.Des exercices de base sont proposées dans de multiples vidéos que vous pouvez visionner sur youtube (ou sur votre smartphone en tapant respirelax).\\xa0Ils ont\\xa0de nombreux effets positifs sur la santé et le bien-être, comme favoriser le recentrage et stabiliser les émotions.\\xa0Leurs bienfaits se font sentir pendant environ cinq heures.Au bout de deux semaines de pratique quotidienne, la chimie du sang change. Il faut deux mois, en pratiquant trois fois par jour, pour obtenir le maximum des effets bénéfiques.Il faut procéder ainsi : vous avez une vidéo, une boule qui monte et qui descend. Quand elle monte vous inspirez, quand elle descend vous expirez, toujours au même rythme que cette boule.Cet exercice se pratique en position assise, le dos droit et les pieds au sol.Il sagit de respirer calmement (six respirations par minute : inspiration quand la boule monte, expiration quand elle descend) pendant cinq minutes .Pour une efficacité optimale, il est conseillé de faire cette pratique trois fois par jour.Quelques vidéos (suffit de taper cohérence cardiaque -éléments, saisons, paysages, etc.) :cohérence cardiaque eau\\xa0cohérence cardiaque plage et végétations des dunes\\xa0\\xa0211\\n', 'Ça a lair intérressant.Je vais examiner ce soir...\\xa0\\xa0\\n', 'jai tenu 1minute30 avant que mon esprit vagabond ne soit ailleurs Modifié le 7 décembre 2018 par Sittelle\\n', 'En hyperventilation?\\n', 'Pour une séance de cohérence cardiaque on vide son esprit, on se réserve cinq minutes rien que pour soi et lon refuse catégoriquement dêtre parasité par toute autre pensée ! Donc pas question de laisser des pensées négatives passer au travers du filet pendant ce temps-là ou même de faire mentalement le planning de sa journée pendant cette séance.Une séance ordinaire se déroule en cinq minutes (cest la cohérence cardiaque 5/5), chaque minute comporte six inspirations et expirations successives de cinq secondes. Exemple : on inspire pendant cinq secondes, puis on expire pendant cinq secondes et ainsi de suite pendant cinq minutes. Une telle séance se fait trois fois par jour.Dans certains cas on peut rallonger ou les expirations ou les inspirations.Exemple avant une épreuve sportive ou quand on est fatigué, pour se redonner du tonus on peut faire la cohérence 6/4 : on inspire pendant six secondes et on expire pendant\\xa0quatre secondes pendant cinq minutes.En revanche pour sapaiser -avant de dormir notamment- la cohérence cardiaque 4/6 est adéquate : on inspire pendant\\xa0quatre secondes et on expire pendant six secondes pendant cinq minutes.Voici un exemple de cohérence cardiaque 4/6 pour bien dormir :\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n', 'Plus difficile à trouver sur youtube la cohérence cardiaque tonifiante 6/4 = six secondes dinspiration, quatre dexpiration par minute (pour ceux qui ont du mal à se réveiller le matin par exemple) :\\xa0(Travailler avec la sonorité si limage ne saffiche pas)\\n', 'Pour les débutants ce nest pas forcément évident de tenir cinq secondes sur cinq secondes, ils peuvent alors saccoutumer à laide dun rythme progressif :\\xa0\\xa0\\n', 'Il existe des vidéos pour les stressés : le rythme est rapide au départ puis ralentit progressivement. Une telle séance peut être pratiquée dans un moment où lon est très énervé et ensuite être suivie dune séance de cohérence cardiaque ordinaire. En effet il vaut mieux se calmer un bon coup si on est énervé ou trop stressé avant une séance ordinaire pour ne pas la gâcher.Un signe que vous allez mieux pendant une telle séance : la montée de salive dans la bouche (réaction naturelle au stress).\\xa0\\xa0\\n', 'Une durée dun minimum de quatre heures\\xa0entre chaque séance est recommandée. Cest bien den faire une le matin, une le midi, une le soir.Vous trouverez sur youtube des vidéos \"cohérence cardiaque - 4 éléments\" = terre, air, eau, feu.La terre est lancrage, la sécurité dans le présent. Pendant la séance vous sentez bien sous vos pieds le sol qui vous soutient, vous êtes en sécurité. Lair vous permet de respirer. Leau est le contrôle de soi, le retour au calme : pendant la séance vous sentez la production de salive, signe que vous êtes en train de vous détendre (alors que le stress, lanxiété, le trac\\xa0sèchent la bouche).

Promotelec vous explique comment déterminer cette chute de tension électrique.Ce que prévoit la NF C 15-100Pour fonctionner, un appareil électrique a besoin d\\x92être alimenté en électricité selon une tension d\\x92alimentation adaptée. Lorsque l\\x92électricité circule dans un câble électrique, une partie de cette électricité se transforme en chaleur (perte par effet joule), ce qui provoque une chute de tension entre le point d\\x92origine de l\\x92installation et l\\x92extrémité finale du câble.Une chute de tension trop importante peut alors provoquer le dysfonctionnement de certains appareils électriques.\\xa0En France, la tension réglementaire de l\\x92alimentation électrique dans l\\x92habitat est de 230 volts en courant monophasé, et de 400 volts en courant triphasé.La norme NF C 15-100, qui régit les installations électriques dans les locaux d\\x92habitation, définit les valeurs acceptables de chute de tension pour assurer la sécurité et la performance des équipements.La norme impose dans le cas d\\x92un raccordement au réseau public de distribution à basse tension que la chute de tension, en tout point, ne dépasse pas :3 % de la tension nominale de l\\x92installation pour l\\x92éclairage ;5 % de la tension nominale de l\\x92installation pour les autres usages (prises de courant, chauffage, recharge pour véhicule électrique \\x85).Pour une alimentation électrique avec une tension de 230 Volts, la tension ne doit pas descendre en dessous de 223 Volts (230x3/100 = 6,9).Source.\\n', 'bon avec vos conseils je peux enfin installer ma climatisation , merci\\n', '\\n'], ['Je déteste ...\\n', '- Les bons apôtres de ce forum\\xa0- Lesprit moutonnier\\xa0- le politiquement correct- La pédanterie- La malhonnêteté- Le narcissisme intellectuel\\xa0\\xa0- La manipulation- Le mensonge pour la bonne cause\\xa0Tout ces\\xa0caractères même dune femme me font autant ramollir le grappin quun chef Gaulois devant larmée Romaine.Et vous ?\\xa0\\xa012\\n', ' tas passé une mauvaise journée ?\\xa012\\n', 'Les mecs qui font des listes.\\xa034\\n', 'Ce ne sont pas des caractères, mais des traits de la personnalité.

A ladolescence les jeunes sont souvent idiots, on parle dâge bête. Soit on subit, soit on suit. On suit souvent pour ne pas subir, et on suit pour faire comme les plus âgés, qui sont nos exemples qui eux ont tous suivi un jour des autres... Chacun essaie de se faire une place dans la société. Ceux qui subissent, eux, rêvent souvent de quitter cette société, sont souvent malheureux, en déprime, voir dépression, ils ne veulent pas suivre car ne veulent pas ressembler à ce modèle du plus fort, et de la compétition alors ils séteignent et prennent des coups, pourtant ce modèle de la complétion et du combat est présent au quotidien et pas que chez les ados. En vieillissant, chacun ou presque, aspirent à des vies similaires, celles de sinscrire dans une société avec des valeurs plus sociales et responsables mais les crocs ne sont jamais loin. Les suiveurs finissent par comprendre que ça ne sert à rien de suivre, quils ne peuvent compter que sur eux même, et ceux qui ont ont subit vont finir par rencontrer un jour dautres personnes, vont reprendre de lassurance en eux et vont aussi comprendre quils doivent davantage se battre dans la vie pour se faire une place dans la société. Cependant, même si chacun sassagit, il y a dans cette vie toujours des combats.\\xa0On ne peut parler de victimes ou de coupables, nous sommes tous responsables de nos destins.

J\\x92ai besoin de discuter avec des personnes qui se sentent comme moi.Je suis quelqu\\x92un de très gentil et sensible ce qui fait que je me fais perpétuellement marcher dessus. Cette situation est pénible et me fais douter de mes capacités. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi le monde est si cruel envers moi. Je ne cherche que l\\x92amour et la paix. J\\x92essaie toujours d\\x92aider les gens de mon mieux et d\\x92être très très positive. Malheureusement la situation fait qu\\x92on finit systématiquement par se servir de moi et ceux depuis que je suis toute petite. Une fois on m\\x92a même dit que j\\x92avais la finesse d\\x92esprit d\\x92une méduse.Suis-je condamnée à vivre dans ses conditions toute ma vie ?\\xa0Déjà à l\\x92école, on me demandait « des services », comme m\\x92allonger bien droite, bras tendus dans une flaque pour faire passerelle entre deux trottoirs. J\\x92exécutais en pensant pouvoir aider et rendre heureux mes amis qui se sont très vite mis à m\\x92utiliser à outrance comme un pont. On me disait que si je faisais le pont, on m\\x92inviterait à tous les anniversaires de la classe et qu\\x92on me donnerait des bonbons multicolores qui piquent. Cette période de mon enfance fut finalement très douce même si elle me value le surnom de « Le gros pont ».En grandissant, je me suis tournée vers des études de biochimie et j\\x92ai obtenu mon diplôme avec brio. Mais ce n\\x92était pas sans encombre. Un groupe d\\x92amis que je m\\x92étais fait dès la première année me jugeais trop benête pour faire partie des échanges animées et des débats tumultueux de nos soirées. Ils me demandaient alors de quitter la pièce le temps de terminer leurs conversations. Quand ils me rappelaient, j\\x92avais eu le temps de préparer des petits plats apéritifs ou cocktails ce qui faisait de moi un élément du groupe indispensable d\\x92après eux.Il est vrai que de moi-même je préférais m\\x92isoler. Même si j\\x92adore\\xa0parler, après quelques mots\\xa0je me retrouve\\xa0très rapidement sans argument. Mon cerveau est\\xa0comme vide et jai beaucoup de mal à saisir les choses subtiles. Faire de l\\x92esprit ça n\\x92a jamais été pour moi !Mais aujourd\\x92hui j\\x92ai décidé d\\x92assumer ma nature et d\\x92être en harmonie avec moi-même. C\\x92est pour cela que je préfère rester chez moi à regarder des programmes tv qui me correspondent.J\\x92évite à tout pris les chaines trop intello qui vous sortent des discours complexes dans un langage scientifique qui ne permet à personne de les comprendre. Quand on parle dans un jargon d\\x92expert, il faut s\\x92attendre à brouiller les informations et cela renforce forcément l\\x92incompréhension des gens comme vous et moi. Il est alors facile de gérer les avis et les critiques puisque personne n\\x92a rien saisi. Je préfère me tourner vers des médias qui traduisent directement les informations dans un langage plus simple que je comprends pleinement.J\\x92adore les programmes tv américain ! La TV réalité, le catch, les combat de Monster truck et les concours de plus gros mangeur sont mes émissions préférées.Ce qui me plait chez les Américains, c\\x92est qu\\x92ils n\\x92ont aucune limite. Personne ne vous juge parce que vous êtes soi-disant plus idiot que la moyenne.
